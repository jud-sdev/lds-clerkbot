    "Clerks in various church units (ward/stake/branch/district) often struggle during their initial months, especially if they haven't received adequate training from their predecessors. The primary aim of this project is to create a tool that provides clerks with the guidance they need whenever they are unsure about their duties, roles, and responsibilities."
