These funds are sacred. They represent the sacrifice and faith of members of the Church (see \nMark 12:41\u201344\n).\n\n\nSome of the uses of tithes and offerings in supporting the Lord\u2019s work include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding and maintaining temples, meetinghouses, and other Church buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporting the activities and operations of the Church and its local congregations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing the gospel throughout the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporting the programs of the Church, such as education and family history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProviding food, shelter, and other necessities to people in need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStake presidents and bishops have a sacred obligation to oversee Church funds (see \nDoctrine and Covenants 72:9\u201310\n). These funds should be used only by authorized members for authorized Church purposes. They must be carefully accounted for and protected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.1\n\n\nStake Financial Leadership\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.1.1\n\n\nStake Presidency\n\n\n\n\nThe stake president has the following responsibilities for stake finances. He delegates some of this work to his counselors and clerks.\n\n\nThe stake president:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaches and inspires members to pay a full tithe and give generous offerings (see \n34.3\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsures that stake funds are properly handled and accounted for (see \n34.5\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReviews the financial statement each month and ensures that any issues are resolved promptly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsures that bishoprics, organization leaders, and clerks learn their responsibility for sacred Church funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepares and manages the annual stake budget (see \n34.6\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsures that stake budget allowance guidelines are followed (see \n34.6.2\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegularly counsels with each bishop to discuss the ward\u2019s finances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerifies that each ward receives members\u2019 tithing declarations annually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsures that passwords to access Church financial systems are never shared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsures that the stake audit committee is organized and functioning properly (see \n34.7.1\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs available to answer questions during audits of stake financial records (see \n34.7\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReviews audits of stake and ward financial records and ensures that any issues are resolved promptly (see \n34.7\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsures that the stake and wards comply with all applicable tax laws (see \n34.8\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.1.2\n\n\nStake Clerks\n\n\n\n\nThe stake president assigns the stake clerk or an assistant stake clerk to help with stake financial record keeping. Clerks carefully follow current policies to safeguard Church funds and ensure that Church records are accurate.\n\n\nThe clerk has the following responsibilities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecord and deposit any funds received with a member of the stake presidency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview the financial statement each month and ensure that any issues are resolved promptly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp the stake presidency prepare the annual stake budget (see \n34.6.1\n and \n34.6.2\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify that each ward has submitted the annual tithing declaration report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipate in financial audits by stake auditors and take corrective actions if needed (see \n34.7\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssist bishoprics with training ward clerks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClerks should hold the Melchizedek Priesthood and have a current temple recommend. For more information about calling stake clerks, see \n33.3.2\n and \n33.3.3\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.2\n\n\nWard Financial Leadership\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.2.1\n\n\nBishopric\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop has the following responsibilities for ward finances. He delegates some of this work to his counselors and clerks.\n\n\nThe bishop:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaches and inspires members to pay a full tithe and give generous offerings (see \n34.3\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsures that ward funds are properly handled and accounted for (see \n34.5\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReviews the financial statement each month and ensures that any issues are resolved promptly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsures that organization leaders and clerks learn their responsibility for sacred Church funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrepares and manages the annual ward budget (see \n34.6\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsures that ward budget allowance guidelines are followed (see \n34.6.2\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeets with ward members annually to receive their tithing declaration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsures that passwords to access Church financial systems are never shared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs available to answer questions during audits of ward financial records and ensures that any issues are resolved promptly (see \n34.7\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.2.2\n\n\nWard Clerks\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop assigns the ward clerk or an assistant ward clerk to help with ward financial record keeping. Clerks carefully follow current policies to safeguard Church funds and ensure that Church records are accurate.\n\n\nThe clerk has the following responsibilities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecord and deposit any funds received with a member of the bishopric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview the financial statement each month and ensure that any issues are resolved promptly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp the bishopric prepare the annual ward budget (see \n34.6.1\n and \n34.6.2\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that members have access to their statements of contributions and assist as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp the bishop prepare and record tithing declarations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipate in financial audits by stake auditors and take corrective actions if needed (see \n34.7\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClerks should hold the Melchizedek Priesthood and have a current temple recommend. For more information about calling ward clerks, see \n33.4.2\n and \n33.4.3\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.3\n\n\nContributions\n\n\n\n\nChurch leaders teach members the principles of tithes and other offerings and encourage members to live these principles. People who are not members of the Church may also make contributions. However, only members of the Church may pay tithing.\n\n\nMembers are encouraged to make their contributions online where possible (see \ndonations.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n). Members may also give their contributions and a completed Tithing and Other Offerings form to the bishop or one of his counselors (see \n34.5.2\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.3.1\n\n\nTithing\n\n\n\n\nTithing is the donation of one-tenth of one\u2019s income to God\u2019s Church (see \nDoctrine and Covenants 119:3\u20134\n; \ninterest\n is understood to mean income). All members who have income should pay tithing.\n\n\nThe Lord\u2019s covenant people have lived the law of tithing since ancient times (see \nGenesis 14:18\u201320\n; \nLeviticus 27:30\u201332\n). The Lord has said, \u201cThe tithing of my people \u2026 shall be a standing law unto them forever\u201d (\nDoctrine and Covenants 119:3\u20134\n).\n\n\nTithes are holy to the Lord, and members honor Him by paying tithing. This is an expression of faith in God and His promises. Those who pay tithing receive this promise from the Lord: \u201cProve me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it\u201d (\nMalachi 3:10\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.3.1.1\n\n\nUse of Tithing Funds\n\n\n\n\nTithing donations are always used for the Lord\u2019s purposes, as directed by the Council on the Disposition of the Tithes (see \nDoctrine and Covenants\u00a0120\n). Some of these purposes are outlined in \n34.0\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.3.1.2\n\n\nTithing Declaration\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop meets with each member during the last few months of each year to receive his or her tithing declaration. In rare circumstances when the bishop is absent, the stake president may authorize one of the bishop\u2019s counselors to fulfill this responsibility.\n\n\nAll members are invited to meet with the bishop to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeclare to the bishop their status as tithe payers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure their contribution records are accurate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhenever possible, all members of a family, including children, should attend together.\n\n\nDuring tithing declaration, the bishop expresses appreciation to members for their faithfulness. He also teaches the principle of tithing, encourages members to give a generous fast offering, and discusses other relevant matters.\n\n\nInstructions for tithing declaration are provided by Church headquarters or the assigned area office.\n\n\n\n\n \n \nImage\nfamily talking to man\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.3.2\n\n\nFast Offerings\n\n\n\n\nChurch leaders encourage members to live the law of the fast. This includes giving a generous fast offering (see \n22.2.2\n).\n\n\n \n \n In some wards, the bishop may authorize Aaronic Priesthood holders to collect fast offerings. In deciding this, the bishop considers the number of Aaronic Priesthood holders available, their safety, and the blessing to members who might not otherwise contribute.\n\n\nPriesthood holders should go in pairs when gathering fast offerings. They deliver fast offerings promptly to a member of the bishopric.\n\n\nMembers should not give other contributions, such as tithing or other offerings, to those who gather fast offerings.\n\n\nGuidelines for using fast-offering funds are provided in \n22.5.2\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.3.3\n\n\nMissionary Funds\n\n\n\n\nContributions to the ward missionary fund are used primarily to meet the contribution commitments of full-time missionaries from the ward. Excess funds in a ward may be used to meet the commitments of other missionaries in the stake. Excess funds in a stake may be used for other stakes in the coordinating council as directed by the Area Seventy who presides over the council.\n\n\nWard missionary funds should not be sent directly to individual missionaries. These funds should not be used for any missionary activities in the ward or stake.\n\n\nContributions to the General Missionary Fund are used by the Church in its overall missionary efforts.\n\n\nStake presidents and bishops should send missionary funds that exceed reasonable stake and ward needs to the General Missionary Fund at Church headquarters or to the area office.\n\n\nFor more information about missionary funds and financing missionary service, see \n24.3.4\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.3.4\n\n\nAdditional Contributions\n\n\n\n\nMembers may contribute financially to additional approved categories. If donors are using the Tithing and Other Offerings form, they write the category name in the \u201cOther\u201d section of the form.\n\n\nStakes and wards should not establish categories in the \u201cOther\u201d section to request, collect, or spend funds for projects that are not approved by the Area Presidency. For a list of approved categories, members should contact the ward clerk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.3.5\n\n\nPhilanthropies\n\n\n\n\nPhilanthropies of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a department of the Office of the Presiding Bishopric. This department coordinates and facilitates voluntary philanthropic contributions to the Church and its affiliated charities and activities, other than tithing and other offerings. Assistance in making contributions may be obtained by contacting the Philanthropies office:\n\n\nPhilanthropies\n\n\n1450 North University Avenue\n\n\nProvo, UT 84604-6080\n\n\nTelephone: 1-801-356-5300 or 1-800-525-8074\n\n\nEmail: \nphilanthropies@ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.3.6\n\n\nImage\nicon, guidelines for adaptation\n In-Kind Donations, Including Tithing\n\n\n\n\nThe Church normally discourages making in-kind contributions (non-monetary) as tithing and other offerings. It is preferable for members to dispose of the property themselves and then pay tithing and other donations monetarily. However, in-kind donations may be accepted in certain cases. Such donations may be a common practice in some areas of the world.\n\n\nThe Church accepts (1)\u00a0stocks, bonds, or other securities that are immediately marketable and (2)\u00a0some marketable real estate. Members should email \ndonationsinkind@churchofjesuschrist.org\n for instructions on how to initiate these in-kind donations. If members want to contribute other items, the stake president contacts Church headquarters or the area office for approval before authorizing the bishop to accept them.\n\n\nReceipts to members who make in-kind donations are issued only by Church headquarters or the area office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.3.7\n\n\nContributions Cannot Be Refunded\n\n\n\n\nWhen tithes and other offerings are given to the Church, they belong to the Lord. They are consecrated to Him. All such contributions are freewill offerings. They are made without reservation of purpose, retention of control, ownership in any form, or expectation of any benefit by the donor other than the Lord\u2019s blessings.\n\n\nStake presidents and bishops inform those who contribute tithes and offerings that these contributions cannot be refunded. Nor can prepaid missionary funds be refunded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.4\n\n\nConfidentiality of Tithing and Other Offerings\n\n\n\n\nThe amount of tithing and other offerings paid by a donor is confidential. Only the bishop and those who are authorized to handle or view these contributions should have access to this information. Stake presidencies, bishoprics, and clerks should never inappropriately discuss a member\u2019s tithing status. Nor should they discuss the total amount of tithing or other offerings received.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.5\n\n\nHandling Church Funds\n\n\n\n\nThe stake president and bishop ensure that all Church funds are properly handled. This is a sacred responsibility of their callings. General principles are outlined in the following sections. Bishoprics and clerks are encouraged to review the video \u201c\nSacred Funds, Sacred Responsibilities\n\u201d at least once a year.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.5.1\n\n\nCompanionship Principle\n\n\n\n\nThe companionship principle requires two persons\u2014a member of the bishopric and a clerk, or two members of the bishopric\u2014to be actively involved when recording and disbursing Church funds. This principle is essential to safeguarding sacred funds and protecting Church leaders.\n\n\nLeaders should protect and never share their passwords (see \n33.9.1.1\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.5.2\n\n\nReceiving Tithing and Other Offerings\n\n\n\n\nThe Lord has given bishops the sacred trust of receiving and accounting for the tithes and other offerings of the Saints (see \nDoctrine and Covenants 42:30\u201333\n; \n119\n). Only the bishop and his counselors may receive tithes and other offerings. Under no circumstances should their wives, other members of their families, clerks, or other ward members receive these contributions. The only exception is when Aaronic Priesthood holders are assigned to collect fast offerings (see \n34.3.2\n).\n\n\nChecks should be made payable to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Money received by the bishopric should be recorded and deposited as soon as possible. Church leaders and members should not leave donations unattended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.5.3\n\n\nVerifying and Recording Tithing and Other Offerings\n\n\n\n\nContributions should be verified and recorded on the Sunday they are received. A member of the bishopric and a clerk, or two members of the bishopric, open each envelope together. They verify that the funds enclosed are the same as the amount written on the Tithing and Other Offerings form. They record each donation properly. If the funds and the written amount differ, they contact the donor as soon as possible to resolve the discrepancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.5.4\n\n\nDepositing Tithing and Other Offerings\n\n\n\n\nA deposit should be prepared after ensuring the amounts recorded match the funds received.\n\n\nWhere a 24-hour bank depository is available, the bishopric member and another Melchizedek Priesthood holder deposit the funds in the bank on the same day the funds are opened and verified.\n\n\nWhere a 24-hour bank depository is not available and the bank is closed on Sunday, the bishop designates a Melchizedek Priesthood holder to make the deposit the next business day. Normally this person should be a member of the bishopric. He is accountable for these funds. He should:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that the funds are kept secure until they are deposited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObtain a deposit receipt showing the date and the amount of the deposit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, a bishopric member and a clerk, or two members of the bishopric, should complete the following procedure on the next Sunday before processing donations for that day:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare the deposit receipt to the previous week\u2019s deposit records to verify that the correct amount was deposited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign the deposit receipt and file it with the previous week\u2019s donation information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.5.5\n\n\nSafeguarding Church Funds\n\n\n\n\nMembers who are responsible for Church funds must never leave them in the meetinghouse overnight or leave them unattended at any time, such as during meetings and activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.5.6\n\n\nDonation Statements\n\n\n\n\nDonor Statements of Contributions are available to all members at \ndonations.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n. Leaders should encourage members to regularly review their donor statements. Where applicable, official tax statements are also available at \ndonations.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n, from the local unit, or from the area office.\n\n\n \n \nImage\nwoman writing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.5.7\n\n\nManaging Stake and Ward Payments\n\n\n\n\nAll stake funds are managed in Church financial systems. The stake president manages the stake finances. His counselors and clerks may assist him. The counselor who serves as chairman of the stake audit committee generally should not be involved in stake financial record keeping.\n\n\nAll ward funds are managed in Church financial systems. The bishop manages the ward finances. His counselors and clerks may assist him.\n\n\n \n \n Payments are generally made by electronic funds transfer or by check. In some areas, units may be approved to use bank cards.\n\n\nNo stake or ward expenses may be incurred or paid without the presiding officer\u2019s authorization.\n\n\nTwo authorized leaders must approve each payment. One of them must be a member of the stake presidency or bishopric. Although counselors may be authorized to approve payments, the stake president or bishop must review each payment. Leaders should not approve a payment to themselves.\n\n\nThe stake president\u2019s written approval is required before a bishop may use fast offerings or approve a bishop\u2019s order for himself or his family. Written approval from a member of the Area Presidency is required before a bishop may use fast offerings or approve a bishop\u2019s order for the stake president or his family. See \n22.5.1.2\n for guidelines.\n\n\nA member requesting reimbursement provides a physical or electronic copy of any receipts or invoices. He or she also includes the purpose, amount, and date of the purchase.\n\n\nIf funds are advanced, the member submits a payment request form, noting the purpose, amount, and date. After the expense has been paid, the member then (1)\u00a0provides receipts or invoices for the funds spent and (2)\u00a0returns any unspent funds. Returned funds should be redeposited.\n\n\nAuthorized leaders and clerks should not approve payments without carefully reviewing the expense and receipts or invoices.\n\n\nStakes and wards may not open their own bank accounts or maintain a petty cash fund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.5.7.1\n\n\nImage\nicon, optional resources\n Electronic Payments\n\n\n\n\nIf the stake or ward uses electronic payments, members are encouraged to enter their personal bank account details in the Expense Reimbursement Account section under Settings in Online Donations at \ndonations.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n. The ward or stake should never keep physical or electronic copies of members\u2019 bank account information details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.5.7.2\n\n\nImage\nicon, optional resources\n Checks\n\n\n\n\nIf the stake or ward uses checks, a check should not be signed until it is filled out completely. Checkbooks and blank checks should be stored in a locked file or cabinet. They must not be left unattended when they are not locked securely. If any blank checks are missing, the stake president or bishop immediately reports the numbers of those checks to Church headquarters or the area office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.5.7.3\n\n\nImage\nicon, optional resources\n Payment Cards\n\n\n\n\nIf the stake or ward uses payment cards for local unit expenses, they may be used for point-of-sale transactions or for withdrawing cash. The card transactions and cash withdrawals are automatically uploaded to Church financial systems. All uses of the card should be promptly recorded. If these uses are not recorded, the card may be disabled.\n\n\nAll payment card balances should be brought to zero at least annually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.5.8\n\n\nImage\nicon, guidelines for adaptation\n Cash Boxes\n\n\n\n\nThe area office provides specific guidelines for units that do not have access to a Church-provided bank account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.5.9\n\n\nKeeping Financial Records\n\n\n\n\nEach stake and ward should keep current, accurate financial records. These records help stake presidents and bishops account for and protect sacred Church funds. Accurate records are also necessary for:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing budgets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaging the budget allowance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProviding information to members about their financial contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponding to audits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor information about the use and retention of records and reports, clerks should refer to instructions from Church headquarters or the area office. Financial records should be retained for at least three years plus the current year. Local laws may require longer retention periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.6\n\n\nBudget and Expenditures\n\n\n\n\nThe budget allowance program provides general Church funds to pay for the activities and programs of stakes and wards. This program eliminates the need to receive budget contributions from members. Faithful payment of tithes has made the budget allowance possible.\n\n\nIf necessary, leaders should reduce and simplify activities to stay within the allowance. Most activities should be simple and have little or no cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.6.1\n\n\nStake and Ward Budgets\n\n\n\n\nEvery stake and ward prepares and operates an annual budget. The stake president manages the stake budget, and the bishop manages the ward budget. They may assign a counselor to supervise the budget under their direction. They may also assign a clerk to help prepare and monitor the budget.\n\n\nStake presidencies and bishoprics begin preparing budgets well before the beginning of each calendar year. Guidelines are listed below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview the amounts spent during the previous year to make sure that recurring expenses are considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk organizations to estimate their budget needs in detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompile the budget using approved budgeting practices. Budgets should ensure that projected expenses do not exceed anticipated budget allowance funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe budget tools included in Church financial systems should be used where they are available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.6.2\n\n\nBudget Allowance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.6.2.1\n\n\nAllocation of Budget\n\n\n\n\nBudget funds are allocated quarterly based on attendance in the following categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSacrament meeting\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung men\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung women\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary children ages 7\u201310\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung single adults\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to report attendance accurately and on time (see \n33.5.1.1\n).\n\n\nBefore each quarterly allocation, the stake president receives information on the amount to be distributed. He then determines how much of the funds are allocated to the wards. He works with bishops in a unified, cooperative manner to ensure the stake and wards are funded fairly and adequately. If unforeseen changes occur that may justify altering original budget allocations, the stake president makes sure that fair adjustments are made.\n\n\nThe bishop oversees the allocation of budget allowance funds in the ward. He ensures that organizations in the ward are funded fairly and adequately.\n\n\nPriesthood leaders ensure that the budget allocations and activities for young men and young women are equitable and that allocations for children in Primary are sufficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.6.2.2\n\n\nAppropriate Use of Budget\n\n\n\n\nStake presidents and bishops make sure budget allowance funds are spent wisely. Funds should be used to bless people and to further gospel purposes. Leaders also ensure that all expenditures are within the allowance.\n\n\nStake and ward budget funds should be used to pay for all activities, programs, manuals, and supplies. Members should not usually pay to participate in activities. Nor should they provide materials, supplies, rental or admission fees, or long-distance transportation at their own expense. Members may provide food if doing so is not a burden (see \n20.6.1\n).\n\n\nMembers who want to contribute additional funds to the Church may not designate them for the stake or ward budget. Instead, leaders encourage them to contribute the funds to fast offerings, missionary funds, humanitarian aid, or other authorized donation categories.\n\n\nExpenses for building construction, maintenance, telephones, utilities, computers, and priesthood leader travel are paid from general Church funds according to current guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.6.2.3\n\n\nExcess Budget\n\n\n\n\nExcess budget allowance funds should not be spent. Excess ward funds should be returned to the stake. Excess stake funds are returned to the Church.\n\n\nAs an exception, stakes and wards may retain some unspent funds if they are needed for specific activities that are planned for the next year, such as a youth conference. However, significant portions of the stake or ward budget allowance should not be retained from one year to the next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.6.3\n\n\nFunding Special Activities and Equipment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.6.3.1\n\n\nStake and Multistake Activities\n\n\n\n\nLocal leaders are encouraged to hold stake and multistake activities that provide opportunities to develop unity and friendships, especially among youth and young single adults. Leaders ensure that they budget adequate funds to support an appropriate number of stake and multistake activities.\n\n\nFunding for most multistake activities comes from the budget funds of the participating stakes. Funding for area activities may come from area or Church headquarters budgets when approved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.6.3.2\n\n\nSpecial Activities and Equipment\n\n\n\n\nFor information about special activities and equipment, see \nchapter\u00a020\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.7\n\n\nAudits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.7.1\n\n\nStake Audit Committee\n\n\n\n\nThe stake president appoints a stake audit committee. This committee ensures that stake and ward finances are handled according to Church policy. It consists of one of the stake president\u2019s counselors as chairman and two other stake members who understand or can be trained in financial matters. These brothers or sisters should have current temple recommends.\n\n\nThe counselor who serves as chairman generally should not approve payments or be involved in stake financial record keeping.\n\n\nCommittee members should not be stake auditors. Nor should they do stake or ward financial record keeping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.7.2\n\n\nStake Auditors\n\n\n\n\nThe stake president or his counselor who is chairman of the stake audit committee calls at least two stake auditors. These brothers and sisters should have current temple recommends. If possible, they should be experienced in accounting or auditing. They should be approved by the stake presidency and high council. However, they are not sustained. The stake president determines whether they are set apart.\n\n\nHigh councilors may also serve as stake auditors. However, the stake clerk and assistant stake clerks may not be called as auditors. Those who serve as auditors may also hold other callings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.7.3\n\n\nThe Financial Audit\n\n\n\n\nStake auditors audit financial records of the stake, wards, and FamilySearch centers twice each year. They also audit the financial records of recreational properties once each year. These are opportunities to encourage, support, and kindly train those who have been called to handle the funds of the Lord\u2019s Church.\n\n\nAuditors ensure that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTithing and other contributions are properly recorded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChurch funds are properly used, accounted for, and protected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial records are complete and accurate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unit\u2019s presiding officer and the clerk assigned to finances should be available to answer questions during audits.\n\n\nThe stake president and stake audit committee review all audits. After their review, the stake audit committee chairman and stake president sign the audits. Audits may be signed and submitted before all of the exceptions are corrected. The stake president and stake audit committee ensure that any audit exceptions are promptly corrected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.7.4\n\n\nArea Auditors and Assistant Area Auditors\n\n\n\n\nThe Area Presidency follows the guidelines in the \nGuide to the Area Audit Program\n when calling an area auditor or assistant area auditor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.7.5\n\n\nLoss, Theft, Embezzlement, or Misappropriation of Church Funds\n\n\n\n\nThe stake president or chairman of the stake audit committee should be notified promptly if:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChurch funds have been lost or stolen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA leader has embezzled or misappropriated Church funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stake president or the chairman of the audit committee notifies the Church Auditing Department. He notifies the area controller if the unit is outside the United States and Canada.\n\n\nThe Church Auditing Department (or area controller) sends a loss report form to the stake president or chairman of the audit committee. Under the direction of the Church Auditing Department (or the area controller), the stake president or chairman of the audit committee ensures that the matter is properly examined. He also ensures that the loss form is properly completed and submitted.\n\n\nAfter the examination is complete, if the Church Auditing Department determines that a leader or Church employee has embezzled Church funds or property, membership action should be considered. Guidelines are in \n32.6.3.3\n.\n\n\nIf a major misuse of funds is discovered, the stake president or chairman of the audit committee also notifies the Area Presidency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.7.6\n\n\nStake Clerk or Assistant Stake Clerk Assigned to Finances\n\n\n\n\nThe stake audit committee may assign the stake clerk or the assistant stake clerk assigned to finances to instruct ward leaders in proper financial policy. He also instructs them in procedures related to exceptions disclosed by audits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.7.7\n\n\nFor More Information\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about audit committees, auditors, and audit procedures, see the \nHelp Center\n at \nChurchofJesusChrist.org\n. Stake audit committees may direct questions to the assistant area auditor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.8\n\n\nTaxes\n\n\n\n\nThe tax information in this section applies only in the United States and Canada. If priesthood leaders in the United States and Canada need more information, they should contact the Tax Administration Division:\n\n\nTax Administration\n\n\n50 East North Temple Street, Room 2276\n\n\nSalt Lake City, UT 84150-0022\n\n\nTelephone: 1-801-240-4405 or 1-800-453-3860, extension 2-4405\n\n\nPriesthood leaders outside the United States and Canada contact the area office to resolve questions on taxes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.8.1\n\n\nTax-Exempt Status\n\n\n\n\nThe Church is normally exempt from paying sales, property, income, and other taxes because it is a religious organization. Church buildings and other properties are to be used for the purposes of worship, religious instruction, and other Church-related activities. Stake and ward leaders ensure that Church facilities are not used for political, business, or investment purposes as outlined in the examples in \n35.5.6.1\n and \n35.5.6.3\n. To do so would violate laws that permit tax exemption of Church property.\n\n\nIt is important that stake and ward leaders follow these guidelines to preserve the Church\u2019s tax-exempt status. If one stake or ward misuses the Church\u2019s tax-exempt status, other Church units could be affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.8.2\n\n\nSales and Use Tax\n\n\n\n\nSales and use tax laws and how they apply to the Church vary by country and by state. Leaders contact the Church\u2019s Tax Administration Division or the assigned area office to see if the Church is exempt or must pay such taxes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34.8.3\n\n\nProperty Tax\n\n\n\n\nThe Church\u2019s Tax Administration Division files all property tax exemptions and pays all required property taxes. No action is required by local leaders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrint\n \n \nInclude highlights and underlines\nSign in to use\nInclude footnotes\nCancel\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
