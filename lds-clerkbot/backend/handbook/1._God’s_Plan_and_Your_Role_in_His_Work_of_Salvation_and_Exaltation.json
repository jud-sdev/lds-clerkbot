Thank you for your service. You will bless lives and experience joy as you serve faithfully.\n\n\nThis handbook will help you learn principles of Christlike service and understand your responsibilities. You will be most effective when you align your service in the Church with the work of God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. This chapter will help you gain a vision of:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGod\u2019s plan of happiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGod\u2019s work of salvation and exaltation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1\n\n\nGod\u2019s Plan of Happiness\n\n\n\n\nHeavenly Father provided the plan of happiness to enable us to enjoy all His blessings. His work and glory is to \u201cbring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man\u201d (\nMoses 1:39\n). Immortality is to live forever with a resurrected physical body. Eternal life, or exaltation, is to become like God and live in His presence eternally as families.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGod\u2019s Work and Glory\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFor behold, this is my work and my glory\u2014to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man\u201d (\nMoses 1:39\n).\n\n\n\n\nJesus Christ is central to God\u2019s plan. Because of Heavenly Father\u2019s infinite love for us, He sent His Son to redeem us from sin and death through His atoning sacrifice (see \nJohn 3:16\n). Through His Atonement, Jesus Christ ensures that each of us born on earth will be resurrected and gain immortality.\n\n\nTo receive eternal life, we must \u201ccome unto Christ\u201d (\nMoroni 10:32\n). The Savior\u2019s Atonement makes it possible for us to be cleansed from sin and have our hearts changed so we can receive eternal life and a fulness of joy. Heavenly Father wants all of His children to choose to return to Him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2\n\n\nGod\u2019s Work of Salvation and Exaltation\n\n\n\n\nAs we come unto Christ and help others do the same, we participate in God\u2019s work of salvation and exaltation. This work is guided by the two great commandments to love God and to love our neighbors (see \nMatthew 22:37\u201339\n).\n\n\nGod\u2019s work of salvation and exaltation focuses on four divinely appointed responsibilities. These are outlined below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGod\u2019s Work of Salvation and Exaltation\n\n\n\n\nWe come unto Christ and assist in God\u2019s work by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaring for those in need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInviting all to receive the gospel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniting families for eternity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis handbook will help you understand these four aspects of God\u2019s work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.1\n\n\nLiving the Gospel of Jesus Christ\n\n\n\n\nLiving the gospel of Jesus Christ includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercising faith in Christ, repenting daily, making covenants with God as we receive the ordinances of salvation and exaltation, and enduring to the end by keeping those covenants (see \n3.5.1\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning and teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ at home and at church.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecoming self-reliant in providing for ourselves and our families, both spiritually and temporally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nImage\nsister missionaries teaching woman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2\n\n\nCaring for Those in Need\n\n\n\n\nCaring for those in need includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServing and ministering to individuals, families, and communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSharing resources, including Church assistance, with those in need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelping others become self-reliant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3\n\n\nInviting All to Receive the Gospel\n\n\n\n\nInviting all to receive the gospel includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipating in missionary work and serving as missionaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelping new and returning Church members progress along the covenant path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.4\n\n\nUniting Families for Eternity\n\n\n\n\nUniting families for eternity includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking covenants as we receive our own temple ordinances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovering our deceased ancestors and performing ordinances for them in the temple so they can make covenants with God.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing to the temple regularly, where possible, to worship God and perform ordinances for His children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3\n\n\nThe Purpose of the Church\n\n\n\n\nJesus Christ established His Church to enable individuals and families to assist God in fulfilling His work of salvation and exaltation (see \nEphesians 4:11\u201313\n; see also \n2.2\n in this handbook). To help accomplish this divine purpose, the Church and its leaders provide:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPriesthood authority and keys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovenants and ordinances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProphetic direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScriptures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGospel learning and teaching support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService and leadership opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA community of Saints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.1\n\n\nPriesthood Authority and Keys\n\n\n\n\nThrough the priesthood, God accomplishes His work of salvation and exaltation. The priesthood authority and keys needed to direct God\u2019s work on earth were restored to the Prophet Joseph Smith (see \nDoctrine and Covenants 110:11\u201316\n; \n112:30\n; see also \n3.1\n in this handbook). These keys are held by Church leaders today. These leaders call and authorize others to assist in God\u2019s work (see \nDoctrine and Covenants 107:8, 65\u201367\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.2\n\n\nCovenants and Ordinances\n\n\n\n\nIn Heavenly Father\u2019s plan, we make covenants as we receive the ordinances of salvation and exaltation, such as baptism (see \nJohn 3:5\n; see also \nchapter\u00a018\n in this handbook). These covenants and ordinances are essential for us to become more like God and return to dwell in His presence (see \nDoctrine and Covenants 84:19\u201322\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.3\n\n\nProphetic Direction\n\n\n\n\nThrough His chosen prophets, God reveals truth and provides inspired guidance and warnings (see \nAmos 3:7\n; \nDoctrine and Covenants 1:4\n). This guidance helps us enter and remain on the path leading to eternal life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.4\n\n\nScriptures\n\n\n\n\nUnder the direction of the Lord\u2019s prophets and apostles, the Church provides and preserves the word of God as found in the holy scriptures. The scriptures testify of Christ, teach His gospel, and help us exercise faith in Him (see \nJacob 7:10\u201311\n; \nHelaman 15:7\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.5\n\n\nGospel Learning and Teaching Support\n\n\n\n\nThe Church supports individuals and families in their responsibility to learn the truths of the gospel and teach these truths to family members and others (see \nDoctrine and Covenants 88:77\u201378,\u00a0118\n; see also \n2.2.3\n in this handbook).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.6\n\n\nService and Leadership Opportunities\n\n\n\n\nThrough callings and assignments in the Church, God gives members opportunities to serve and lead. The Church provides structure to help care for members in need and to give humanitarian relief to others (see \nMosiah 18:27\u201329\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.7\n\n\nA Community of Saints\n\n\n\n\nAs a community of Saints, Church members gather regularly to worship God and to remember the Savior by partaking of the sacrament (see \nMoroni 6:4\u20136\n; \nDoctrine and Covenants 20:77\n). Members also care for and minister to one another (see \nEphesians 2:19\n).\n\n\n\n\n \n \nImage\ntemple, Tijuana Mexico\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4\n\n\nYour Role in God\u2019s Work\n\n\n\n\nAs a leader in the Church, you are called to teach and support those you serve as they assist God in His work of salvation and exaltation (see \n1.2\n). Having a clear understanding of God\u2019s work, of what He invites you to do, and of the purpose of His Church will help you focus your efforts in bringing souls to Christ.\n\n\nPrayerfully seek to know how you can help bring about God\u2019s purposes in the lives of those you serve. God will direct you through the promptings of the Holy Ghost (see \n2\u00a0Nephi 32:5\n). Laboring with the Lord in His vineyard will bring you great joy (see \nJacob 5:70\u201372\n).\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrint\n \n \nInclude highlights and underlines\nSign in to use\nInclude footnotes\nCancel\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
