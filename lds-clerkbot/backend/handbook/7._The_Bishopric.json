He and his counselors form a bishopric. They receive guidance from the stake presidency. They care for ward members with love, helping them become true followers of Jesus Christ (see \nMoroni 7:48\n).\n\n\nThe bishop and his counselors are high priests. If they are not high priests when they are called, they should be ordained high priests before they are set apart to serve.\n\n\nThe bishop has five principal responsibilities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is the presiding high priest in the ward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is president of the Aaronic Priesthood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is a common judge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe coordinates God\u2019s work of salvation and exaltation in the ward, including caring for those in need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe oversees records, finances, and the use of the meetinghouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the bishop holds priesthood keys, he has the right to receive revelation for the ward (see \nDoctrine and Covenants 128:11\n). Therefore, some responsibilities are his alone. These are described in this chapter.\n\n\nThe bishop\u2019s foremost responsibility is to the rising generation in the ward (the children, youth, and young single adults). To enable him to concentrate on this responsibility, he delegates many assignments (see \n4.2.5\n). He may delegate to his counselors, the clerk and assistant clerks, the executive secretary, quorum and organization leaders, and others.\n\n\nIf the bishop is unable to perform his responsibilities, a counselor may act in his place temporarily, except as noted in this handbook. The bishop or his counselor consults with the stake president if he has questions about the counselor acting for the bishop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.1\n\n\nPresiding High Priest\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop is the ward\u2019s primary spiritual leader. He sets an example by serving \u201cwith holiness of heart\u201d (\nMosiah 18:12\n). He teaches, uplifts, and inspires (see \nMatthew 20:28\n). He follows the principles of leadership in \nDoctrine and Covenants 121:34\u201346\n.\n\n\nA bishop is a faithful disciple of Jesus Christ. He is true to his covenants. He is loyal to his wife and family. He sets an example of righteousness for his family, the ward, and the community. (See \n1\u00a0Timothy 3:2\u20137\n.) His counselors are men of similar character.\n\n\nThe bishop provides guidance and counsel to other leaders in the ward. He encourages them in their responsibilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.1.1\n\n\nWard Organizations and Priesthood Quorums\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop has responsibility for the ward Relief Society and Young Women organizations. He assigns his counselors responsibility for the Sunday School and Primary organizations and other ward programs. (See \n9.3.1\n, \n11.3.1\n, \n12.3.1\n, and \n13.2.1\n.)\n\n\nThe bishop\u2019s responsibilities for Aaronic Priesthood quorums are outlined in \n7.1.2\n. His responsibilities for elders quorums are outlined in \n8.3.1\n.\n\n\nThe bishop also guides the elders quorum and Relief Society presidents in overseeing ministering. He meets with these two presidents together at least quarterly to address the needs of individuals and families (see \n21.2\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.1.2\n\n\nOrdinances and Blessings\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop directs the administration of the following ordinances and blessings in the ward:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sacrament\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaming and blessing of children\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaptism and confirmation of 8-year-old children of record (for those with intellectual disabilities, see \n38.2.8.1\n; for converts, see \n31.2.3.2\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConferral of the Aaronic Priesthood and ordination to the offices of deacon, teacher, and priest\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor information about ordinances and blessings, see \nchapter\u00a018\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.1.3\n\n\nCouncils and Meetings\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop leads the ward council and the ward youth council (see \n29.2.5\n and \n29.2.6\n). He uses these councils to help coordinate God\u2019s work of salvation and exaltation in the ward. He delegates much of this work and follows up on assignments (see \n4.2.5\n).\n\n\nThe bishop invites leaders to counsel together about how to build spiritual strength and unity in the ward. He encourages all council members to seek inspiration and participate in discussions. (See \nDoctrine and Covenants 88:122\n; see also \n4.4\n in this handbook.)\n\n\nThe bishopric plans sacrament meetings and other ward meetings listed in \nchapter\u00a029\n. The bishop presides at ward meetings unless a member of the stake presidency, an Area Seventy in his area, or a General Authority attends. The bishop\u2019s counselors may conduct these meetings. They also preside if the bishop is absent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.1.4\n\n\nCallings and Releases\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop\u2019s responsibilities for callings and releases are outlined in \nchapter\u00a030\n. He may assign his counselors to extend callings and releases as outlined in \n30.8\n.\n\n\n\n\n \n \nImage\nman and woman shaking hands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.2\n\n\nPresident of the Aaronic Priesthood\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe bishopric is the presidency of [the Aaronic] priesthood, and holds the keys or authority of the same\u201d (\nDoctrine and Covenants 107:15\n; see also \nverse\u00a020\n). The bishop has the following responsibilities as the president of the Aaronic Priesthood in the ward. His counselors assist him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport parents in teaching youth. Help youth serve faithfully, make and keep sacred covenants, and prepare to receive the ordinances of the temple. Help young men prepare to be ordained to priesthood offices and to serve full-time missions. If young women desire to serve full-time missions, help them prepare. The Children and Youth program can help in these efforts (see \nChildrenandYouth.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOversee Aaronic Priesthood quorums and Young Women classes. The bishop is president of the priests quorum (see \nDoctrine and Covenants 107:87\u201388\n). His first counselor has responsibility for the teachers quorum. His second counselor has responsibility for the deacons quorum. For more information about Aaronic Priesthood quorum leadership, see \n10.3\n, \n10.4\n, and \n10.5\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounsel with the ward Young Women president. The bishop does not delegate this assignment to a counselor. He and his counselors also regularly participate in Young Women meetings, service, and activities. (See \n11.3.1\n.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet regularly with each youth. For guidelines about these meetings, see \n31.3.1\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport families and Primary leaders and teachers in their efforts to help children make and keep covenants (see \nchapter\u00a012\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.3\n\n\nCommon Judge\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop is the common judge in the ward (see \nDoctrine and Covenants 107:71\u201374\n). He strives to follow the example of the Savior as a righteous judge (see \n3\u00a0Nephi 27:27\n). He has the following responsibilities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp youth and adults qualify for and be worthy of a temple recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConduct interviews as outlined in \n31.2\n. He may authorize his counselors to conduct certain interviews (see \n31.2.2\n). For guidelines, see \n31.1\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet with ward members who seek spiritual guidance, who have weighty personal problems, or who have committed serious sins, helping them draw on the healing power of Jesus Christ. The bishop may ask his counselors, elders quorum and Relief Society presidents, and others to meet with ward members about some matters. However, only the bishop meets with ward members about matters of worthiness, abuse, and approval to use fast-offering funds. For guidelines, see \n31.1\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the direction of the stake president, hold membership councils as needed. For guidelines, see \nchapter\u00a032\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.4\n\n\nCoordinating God\u2019s Work of Salvation and Exaltation in the Ward\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop coordinates God\u2019s work of salvation and exaltation in the ward (see \nchapter\u00a01\n). His counselors and other ward leaders assist him.\n\n\nThe bishop helps members live the gospel. He helps them strengthen their faith in Heavenly Father and in Jesus Christ and His Atonement (see \nDoctrine and Covenants 20:29\n). He teaches them to pray and study the scriptures. He invites them to make covenants by receiving the ordinances of salvation and exaltation. He encourages them to keep their covenants.\n\n\nThe bishop strengthens Church members. He encourages families to participate in regular family prayer and learn the gospel together, including in home evening. He teaches them to love and serve one another. He teaches by word and example that Church callings can be fulfilled without detracting from family responsibilities. He ensures that Church activities support parents\u2019 efforts to raise their children in righteousness.\n\n\nIn addition to helping members live the gospel, the bishop has other responsibilities in coordinating God\u2019s work of salvation and exaltation in the ward. For example, he:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelps men prepare to be ordained to priesthood offices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads efforts to care for those in need in the ward (see \n7.1.4.1\n and \n22.2.1\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuides the elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies as they lead ministering efforts in the ward (see \n21.2.1\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordinates the work of the elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies as they lead the ward\u2019s efforts to share the gospel and strengthen new and returning members (see \n23.1\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordinates the efforts of the elders quorum and Relief Society presidencies as they lead temple and family history work in the ward (see \n25.2\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelps members prepare to receive a temple recommend and temple ordinances (see \n27.1\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.4.1\n\n\nLeading Efforts to Care for Those with Temporal Needs\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop has a divine mandate to seek out and care for those with temporal needs (see \nDoctrine and Covenants 84:112\n). He delegates much of this work to the Relief Society and elders quorum presidencies.\n\n\nSome duties are performed only by the bishop. For example, he determines the type, amount, and duration of any temporal assistance provided by the Church. In doing so, he often consults with the Relief Society and elders quorum presidents. For more information, see \n22.4\n and \n22.5\n.\n\n\nMembers of the bishopric teach the principles of caring for those in need and building self-reliance (see \n22.1\n). They also teach the law of the fast (see \n22.2.2\n). They oversee the gathering of fast offerings (see \n34.3.2\n).\n\n\nThe bishop instructs other ward leaders in their responsibilities to care for those in need. He also leads the ward council in these efforts.\n\n\nFor more information about how the bishop cares for those in need, see \n22.6.1\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.5\n\n\nRecords, Finances, and the Meetinghouse\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop oversees ward records, ward finances, and the meetinghouse. This includes his responsibility to teach tithing and the law of the fast and to conduct tithing declaration (see \n34.3.1.2\n; see also \nDoctrine and Covenants 107:68\n).\n\n\n \n \n The bishop may assign much of the work with records and finances to his counselors and clerks. He may assign one of his counselors to serve as the ward building representative, or he may call another member to do so.\n\n\nFor information about records, see \nchapter\u00a033\n. For information about finances, including tithing, see \nchapter\u00a034\n. For information about meetinghouses, see \nchapter\u00a035\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2\n\n\nDifferences between Branch Presidencies and Bishoprics\n\n\n\n\nIn a branch, a Melchizedek Priesthood holder is called as the branch president. He holds the priesthood keys needed to preside (see \n3.4.1.1\n). He and his counselors serve much like a bishopric but with the following differences:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA branch president may be either an elder or a high priest. A bishop must be a high priest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA branch president is not set apart as a presiding high priest. However, he presides over the branch and has all of the responsibilities described in \n7.1.1\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA branch president does not need to be married.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounselors in a branch presidency may not issue temple recommends (see \n26.3.1\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nImage\nbishopric meeting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3\n\n\nWard Executive Secretary and Assistant Ward Executive Secretaries\n\n\n\n\nThe bishopric recommends a Melchizedek Priesthood holder to serve as ward executive secretary. They make this recommendation to the stake presidency. The executive secretary should have a current temple recommend. He is called and set apart by a member of the stake presidency or an assigned high councilor.\n\n\nThe executive secretary works closely with the bishop and his counselors, but he is not a member of the bishopric. He has the following responsibilities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet with the bishopric and prepare agendas as assigned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServe as a member of the ward council and attend ward council meetings. As directed by the bishopric, follow up on assignments made in these meetings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule appointments for the bishopric.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule interviews for youth and adults who need to renew their temple recommends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf assigned by the bishopric, coordinate the ward\u2019s efforts to help members access Church magazines (see \n38.8.7\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp the bishopric with seminary and institute matters, such as helping ward members register for classes (see \nchapter\u00a015\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep a current list of names and addresses of ward members who are in the military. Ensure that ward leaders are aware of these members (see \n38.9.2\n). Inform the stake executive secretary when members plan to enter the military.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForward messages received from Church employees and volunteers to the appropriate ward leaders, as instructed by the bishop (see \n38.8.9\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne or two assistant ward executive secretaries may be called as needed. They are recommended by the bishopric and called and set apart by a member of the stake presidency or an assigned high councilor. These brethren should have a current temple recommend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4\n\n\nWard Clerk and Assistant Ward Clerks\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop recommends a Melchizedek Priesthood holder to serve as ward clerk. He makes this recommendation to the stake presidency. The clerk should have a current temple recommend. He is called and set apart by a member of the stake presidency or an assigned high councilor. He is a member of the ward council.\n\n\nAssistant ward clerks may also be called (see \n33.4.3\n). They are called and set apart by a member of the stake presidency or an assigned high councilor.\n\n\nClerks work closely with the bishop and his counselors, but they are not members of the bishopric. The responsibilities of the ward clerk and assistant ward clerks are outlined in \n33.4.2\n and \n33.4.3\n.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrint\n \n \nInclude highlights and underlines\nSign in to use\nInclude footnotes\nCancel\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
