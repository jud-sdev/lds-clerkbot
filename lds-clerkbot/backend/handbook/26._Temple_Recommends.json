Ward and stake leaders encourage all members to be worthy of and to have a current temple recommend even if they do not live near a temple.\n\n\nChurch leaders make every effort to see that all who enter the house of the Lord are worthy to do so (see \nPsalm 24:3\u20135\n). Authorized priesthood leaders conduct temple recommend interviews and issue temple recommends to members who answer the interview questions appropriately and sincerely (see \n26.3\n). The Lord promises that if those who enter His house are clean, His presence will be there (see \nDoctrine and Covenants 97:15\u201316\n).\n\n\nMembers must have a current temple recommend to enter a temple. Children younger than age\u00a08 who are being sealed to their parents or observing the sealing of their siblings to their parents do not need a recommend (see \n26.4.4\n).\n\n\nThis chapter provides instructions for leaders who issue temple recommends. A bishop counsels with his stake president if he has questions about temple recommends that are not answered in this chapter. The stake president may contact the Office of the First Presidency with questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.1\n\n\nTypes of Temple Recommends\n\n\n\n\nA current temple recommend allows a member to enter all temples. Priesthood leaders ensure that members receive the correct recommend for their circumstances. There are three types of recommends:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemple recommend for unendowed members.\n These recommends are for unendowed members who are being sealed to their parents or performing proxy baptisms and confirmations. They are issued through \nLeader and Clerk Resources (LCR)\n. For more information, see \n26.4\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemple recommend for living ordinances.\n These recommends are for members receiving their own endowment or being sealed to a spouse. They are issued from recommend book\u00a02. The recommend for living ordinances is attached to a regular temple recommend for endowed members (described below). The temple retains the living ordinance recommend when the ordinance is performed. The member retains the regular recommend and uses it when returning to the temple.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemple recommend for endowed members.\n These recommends are for members who have previously been endowed. They are issued through \nLCR\n. They authorize a member to participate in all temple ordinances for the deceased. They are also used when an endowed member is sealed to living or deceased parents or children. For more information, see \n26.3\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.2\n\n\nSafeguarding Temple Recommends\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.2.1\n\n\nPriesthood Leaders Safeguarding Temple Recommends\n\n\n\n\nPriesthood leaders who are authorized to have temple recommend books should carefully safeguard them. No other person should have access to them. When the Church updates temple recommend books, leaders destroy the outdated books.\n\n\nPriesthood leaders also ensure that unauthorized individuals do not have access to temple recommend information in \nLCR\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.2.2\n\n\nLost or Stolen Recommends\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop asks members to notify him as soon as possible if their recommend is lost or stolen. He or an assigned counselor or clerk uses \nLCR\n to cancel the recommend as soon as possible. If this system is not available, the bishop contacts the temple office to have the recommend canceled.\n\n\nThe bishop or an assigned counselor then conducts a temple recommend interview with the member. If the member is worthy, the bishop or assigned counselor either reprints the recommend or issues a new one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.2.3\n\n\nRecommend Holders Who Are Not Living the Standards of Worthiness\n\n\n\n\nIf the bishop determines that a member who has a current recommend is not living the standards of worthiness (see \n26.3\n), he requests the recommend from the member. He uses \nLCR\n to cancel the recommend. If this system is not available, the bishop contacts the temple office to have the recommend canceled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.3\n\n\nGeneral Guidelines for Issuing Temple Recommends\n\n\n\n\nAuthorized priesthood leaders conduct interviews before a member can receive a temple recommend. Instructions are in \nLCR\n. Priesthood leaders should issue a recommend only if the member answers the temple recommend questions appropriately.\n\n\nTemple recommend interviews allow members to demonstrate that they have a testimony and are striving to obey God\u2019s commandments and follow His prophets. Priesthood leaders also affirm, through the interview, that the member is worthy. See \n26.3.3\n for additional information about conducting temple recommend interviews.\n\n\nIn stakes, a member of the stake presidency or a stake clerk activates the temple recommend in \nLCR\n after it is issued. In districts, a member of the mission presidency or a mission clerk activates the recommend. Recommends for proxy baptisms and confirmations are activated when they are printed by a member of the bishopric or by the branch president. He uses \nLCR\n to print the recommends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.3.1\n\n\nTemple Recommend Interviews for Members in Wards and Branches\n\n\n\n\nIn a ward, the bishop or an assigned counselor conducts temple recommend interviews and issues recommends to those who are worthy. In a branch, only the branch president conducts temple recommend interviews and issues recommends.\n\n\nIn a ward, the bishop personally interviews members who:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre receiving their own endowment (see \n27.1\n and \n27.2\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre being sealed to a spouse (see \n27.3\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn urgent cases when the bishop is unavailable, he may authorize one of his counselors to conduct these interviews.\n\n\nIn large young single adult wards, bishops may authorize experienced counselors to conduct these interviews.\n\n\nBefore issuing a recommend in the situations listed above, the bishop reviews the member\u2019s record to verify that it does not include a notation about Church membership restrictions. For members receiving their own endowment or being sealed to a spouse, he also ensures that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe person\u2019s baptism and confirmation are recorded on the membership record.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrethren have received the Melchizedek Priesthood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, dates for a member\u2019s baptism and confirmation or Melchizedek Priesthood ordination have not been recorded. In these situations, the ordinances must be verified and recorded, ratified, or performed again (see \n38.2.6\n).\n\n\nAfter the interview by a member of the bishopric or the branch president, a member of the stake presidency interviews members who live in a stake. He signs the recommends of those who are worthy. A member of the mission presidency conducts the second interview for members who live in a district. He also signs the recommends of those who are worthy. A district president does not conduct temple recommend interviews unless authorized by the First Presidency.\n\n\nThe stake or mission president personally interviews members who:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre receiving their own endowment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre being sealed to a spouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the stake president is unavailable, he may authorize his counselors to conduct these interviews.\n\n\nA mission president may authorize his counselors to conduct these interviews as needed.\n\n\nIn a young single adult stake, the stake president may authorize his counselors to conduct these interviews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.3.2\n\n\nImage\nicon, guidelines for adaptation\n Temple Recommend Interviews for Members in Isolated Areas\n\n\n\n\nSome members live in areas that would require expensive travel or great difficulty to meet with a member of the stake or mission presidency. In these situations, a temple president may interview the person and sign the recommend. Before conducting the interview, he confers with the stake or mission president. The bishop, an authorized counselor, or the branch president should have already interviewed the member and signed the recommend.\n\n\nThis policy also applies to members in the military who are in isolated areas. They should first be interviewed by the bishop of their home ward or the unit that supports their duty station.\n\n\n \n \nImage\nyouth outside temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.3.3\n\n\nConducting a Temple Recommend Interview\n\n\n\n\nThe temple is the house of the Lord. Entering the temple and participating in ordinances there is a sacred privilege. This privilege is reserved for those who are spiritually prepared and striving to live the Lord\u2019s standards, as determined by authorized priesthood leaders.\n\n\nTo make this determination, priesthood leaders interview the member using the questions below. Leaders should not add or remove any requirements. However, they may adapt the questions to the age and circumstances of the member.\n\n\nSometimes members have questions during a temple recommend interview. The priesthood leader may explain basic gospel principles. He may also help members understand the temple recommend questions if needed. However, he should not present his personal beliefs, preferences, or interpretations as Church doctrine or policy.\n\n\nTemple recommend interviews should not be rushed. They should be private. However, the person being interviewed may invite a spouse, parent, or another adult to be present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.3.3.1\n\n\nTemple Recommend Interview Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have faith in and a testimony of God, the Eternal Father; His Son, Jesus Christ; and the Holy Ghost?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have a testimony of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and of His role as your Savior and Redeemer?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have a testimony of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you sustain the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as the prophet, seer, and revelator and as the only person on the earth authorized to exercise all priesthood keys?\n\n\nDo you sustain the members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles as prophets, seers, and revelators?\n\n\nDo you sustain the other General Authorities and local leaders of the Church?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lord has said that all things are to be \u201cdone in cleanliness\u201d before Him (\nDoctrine and Covenants 42:41\n).\n\n\nDo you strive for moral cleanliness in your thoughts and behavior?\n\n\nDo you obey the law of chastity?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you follow the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ in your private and public behavior with members of your family and others?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you support or promote any teachings, practices, or doctrine contrary to those of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you strive to keep the Sabbath day holy, both at home and at church; attend your meetings; prepare for and worthily partake of the sacrament; and live your life in harmony with the laws and commandments of the gospel?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you strive to be honest in all that you do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you a full-tithe payer?\n\n\nFor new members seeking a recommend to perform proxy baptisms and confirmations: Are you willing to obey the commandment to pay tithing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you understand and obey the Word of Wisdom?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(This question is omitted when interviewing a child or youth.)\n Do you have any financial or other obligations to a former spouse or to children?\n\n\nIf yes, are you current in meeting those obligations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(This question is omitted when interviewing a member who is not endowed.)\n Do you keep the covenants that you made in the temple?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(This question is omitted when interviewing a member who is not endowed.)\n Do you honor your sacred privilege to wear the garment as instructed in the initiatory ordinances? (Read the \u201c\nWearing the Temple Garment\n\u201d statement, included below, to each member.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there serious sins in your life that need to be resolved with priesthood authorities as part of your repentance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you consider yourself worthy to enter the Lord\u2019s house and participate in temple ordinances?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.3.3.2\n\n\nWearing the Temple Garment\n\n\n\n\nThe First Presidency has provided the following guidance on wearing the garment:\n\n\n\u201cThe garment of the holy priesthood reminds us of the veil in the temple, and that veil is symbolic of Jesus Christ. When you put on your garment, you put on a sacred symbol of Jesus Christ. Wearing it is an outward expression of your inner commitment to follow Him. The garment is also a reminder of your temple covenants. You should wear the garment day and night throughout your life. When it must be removed for activities that cannot reasonably be done while wearing the garment, seek to restore it as soon as possible. As you keep your covenants, including the sacred privilege to wear the garment as instructed in the initiatory ordinances, you will have greater access to the Savior\u2019s mercy, protection, strength, and power.\u201d\n\n\nIf members have questions about wearing the garment, refer them to \n38.5\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.3.3.3\n\n\nAdditional Direction\n\n\n\n\nThe priesthood leader emphasizes to the member the need to safeguard his or her recommend. It must never be loaned and should be reported immediately to the issuer if lost or stolen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.4\n\n\nIssuing Temple Recommends to Unendowed Members\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.4.1\n\n\nGeneral Guidelines\n\n\n\n\nIn a ward, the bishop or an assigned counselor interviews unendowed members for temple recommends. In a branch, only the branch president conducts temple recommend interviews. The leader follows the guidelines in \n26.3\n. He issues a recommend if the person is worthy.\n\n\nTemple recommends are issued to unendowed members as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor members ages\u00a011 and older to be baptized and confirmed for the dead. (Young women and ordained young men are eligible for a temple recommend beginning in January of the year they turn\u00a012.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor members ages\u00a08 through\u00a020 to be sealed to their parents. Children younger than\u00a08 do not need a recommend to be sealed to their parents (see \n26.4.4\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor members ages\u00a08 through\u00a020 to observe the sealings of their living siblings, stepsiblings, or half siblings to their parents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers who have been previously endowed are not issued any of the recommends explained in this section.\n\n\nA male Church member who is old enough to hold the priesthood must be ordained to a priesthood office before he may receive a temple recommend.\n\n\nWhen issuing a temple recommend, a member of the bishopric or the branch president interviews the person individually. However, the person may invite a parent or another adult to be present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.4.2\n\n\nTemple Recommends for Newly Baptized Members\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop interviews new members who are of an appropriate age to receive a temple recommend for proxy baptisms and confirmations only. He conducts this interview soon after the member\u2019s confirmation, normally within a week (see \n26.4.1\n). For brethren, this interview may be held as part of the interview to receive the Aaronic Priesthood. Male Church members must be ordained to a priesthood office before receiving a temple recommend.\n\n\nWorthy adult members may receive their own endowment one full year after being confirmed a member of the Church (see \n27.2.1.1\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.4.3\n\n\nTemple Recommends for Proxy Baptisms and Confirmations Only\n\n\n\n\nTemple recommends that are issued for proxy baptisms and confirmations may be used only for that purpose. These recommends are printed using \nLCR\n. They require only the signatures of the member and of a member of the bishopric or the branch president.\n\n\nFor information about scheduling baptisms and confirmations for the dead, see \n28.2.1\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.4.4\n\n\nTemple Recommends for Sealing Living Children to Parents\n\n\n\n\nUnendowed members ages\u00a08 through\u00a020 are issued temple recommends to participate in sealings as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be sealed to their parents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo observe the sealing of their living siblings, stepsiblings, or half siblings to their parents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose who are issued temple recommends to participate in sealings are interviewed by a member of the bishopric or the branch president. They are also interviewed by a member of the stake or mission presidency.\n\n\nA member of the bishopric or the branch president prints these recommends using \nLCR\n. Temple recommends for sealings may be issued for individual children or for a group of children in the same family. The same recommend may be used to list children who are being sealed and those who are observing.\n\n\nChildren under age\u00a08 do not need a recommend to be sealed to their parents. Nor do they need a recommend to observe the sealing of their siblings, stepsiblings, or half siblings to their parents.\n\n\nMembers who are\u00a021 or older may be sealed to their parents or observe a sealing only if they are (1)\u00a0endowed and (2)\u00a0have a current temple recommend.\n\n\nSee \n27.4.4\n and \n38.4.2\n for additional policies on observing sealings and being sealed to parents.\n\n\n \n \nImage\nyouth holding recommends outside temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.5\n\n\nIssuing Temple Recommends in Special Circumstances\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.5.1\n\n\nMembers Receiving Their Own Endowment\n\n\n\n\nInstructions for issuing a recommend to a person who is receiving his or her own endowment are provided in temple recommend book\u00a02. Worthy members who desire to receive their own endowment may do so when they meet all of the following conditions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are at least 18\u00a0years old.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have completed or are no longer attending high school, secondary school, or the equivalent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne full year has passed since their confirmation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey feel a desire to receive and honor temple covenants throughout their lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, a man must hold the Melchizedek Priesthood before receiving his endowment. For information about members preparing to receive their own endowment, see \n25.2.8\n. For information about who may receive the endowment, see \n27.2.1\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.5.2\n\n\nNewly Baptized Members\n\n\n\n\nWorthy adult members may receive their own endowment one full year after being confirmed a member of the Church (see \n27.2.1.1\n). Priesthood leaders ensure that the date the member will receive the endowment will be at least one full year after his or her confirmation date, not the baptismal date. Only the First Presidency may authorize exceptions.\n\n\nNew members who are worthy should be issued a temple recommend for proxy baptisms and confirmations only (see \n26.4.2\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.5.3\n\n\nYoung Missionaries Returning from Service Away from Home\n\n\n\n\nBefore a young missionary serving away from home completes his or her service, the mission president conducts a temple recommend interview. If the missionary is worthy, he issues a recommend. The mission president dates and activates the recommend so it expires three months from the date the missionary returns home.\n\n\nThe bishop interviews returned missionaries to issue a new temple recommend near the end of the three-month expiration period. In urgent cases when the bishop is unavailable, he may authorize one of his counselors to conduct these interviews.\n\n\nIn large young single adult wards, bishops may authorize experienced counselors to conduct these interviews.\n\n\nReturned missionaries then meet with a member of their stake presidency for a temple recommend interview.\n\n\nIn these temple recommend interviews, the bishop and member of the stake presidency also review counsel given in the missionary\u2019s release interview (see \n24.8.2\n). They discuss the returned missionary\u2019s progress, well-being, and current Church calling. They also encourage him or her to continue on a lifelong path of spiritual growth and service.\n\n\nIf the returned missionary does not have a Church calling, the bishop and stake president make certain that one is extended. Returned missionaries may be recommended to serve as temple ordinance workers or volunteers if a temple is nearby (see \n25.5\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.5.4\n\n\nMembers Who Have Not Lived in the Same Ward for at Least One Year\n\n\n\n\nIf a member has not lived in the same ward continuously for at least one year, the bishop reviews the member\u2019s record to verify that it does not include a notation about Church membership restrictions.\n\n\nThe bishop or an assigned counselor contacts the prior bishop before conducting a temple recommend interview. If a counselor learns that there is confidential information, he ends the conversation. He informs his bishop to contact the prior bishop before an interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.5.5\n\n\nAfter Divorce, Separation, or Annulment\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop and stake president may feel impressed to interview a member who has been divorced or legally separated or had a marriage annulled since last receiving a temple recommend. During this interview, they help strengthen the member spiritually. They also verify the member\u2019s continued temple worthiness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.5.6\n\n\nMembers Whose Close Relatives Publicly Oppose the Church or Belong to Apostate Groups\n\n\n\n\nBishops and their counselors should be sensitive when issuing recommends to members whose close relatives publicly oppose the Church or belong to apostate groups. Members in these circumstances should not be made to feel that they cannot have a temple recommend because of their family associations. They should be encouraged to maintain a loving relationship with close relatives. They may be issued a temple recommend if they answer all temple recommend questions appropriately and sincerely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.5.7\n\n\nMembers Who Identify as Transgender\n\n\n\n\nWorthy members who identify as transgender but do not pursue a medical, surgical, or social transition to the opposite of their biological sex at birth (\u201csex reassignment\u201d) may receive a temple recommend and temple ordinances.\n\n\nTemple ordinances are received according to a person\u2019s biological sex at birth. For this reason, the following members may not receive a temple recommend, including a recommend for proxy baptisms and confirmations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers who have received elective medical or surgical intervention to attempt to transition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers who have socially transitioned to the opposite of their biological sex at birth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stake president should counsel with the Area Presidency to address individual situations with sensitivity and Christlike love (see \n38.6.23\n and \n38.7.7\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.5.8\n\n\nMembers Who Have Committed a Serious Sin\n\n\n\n\nA member who has committed a serious sin may not receive a temple recommend until he or she has repented (see \n32.6\n). The period between the sin and the issuing of a recommend is left to the discretion of the bishop and stake president. It should be sufficient to determine that the person has genuinely repented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.5.9\n\n\nMembers Who Have Been Readmitted after Church Membership Withdrawal or Resignation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.5.9.1\n\n\nMembers Who Were Not Previously Endowed\n\n\n\n\nAfter a member who was not previously endowed has been readmitted by baptism and confirmation, the bishop may interview him or her to receive a temple recommend for proxy baptisms and confirmations (see \n26.4.2\n).
