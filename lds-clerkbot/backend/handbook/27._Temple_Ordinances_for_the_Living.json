He has sometimes allowed His holy ordinances to be administered outside of temples when there was no dedicated temple (see \nGenesis 28:12\u201322\n; \nExodus\u00a024\n; \nExodus 25:8\u20139\n; \nEther\u00a03\n). But whenever the Lord has established His Church, He has commanded His people to build a house \u201cunto [His] name.\u201d There He reveals His ordinances and the glories of His kingdom and teaches the way of salvation. (See \n2\u00a0Chronicles 3\u20135\n; \n2\u00a0Nephi 5:16\n; \nDoctrine and Covenants 97:10\u201316\n; \n124:29\u201339\n.)\n\n\nThe temple is the house of the Lord. It points us to our Savior, Jesus Christ. In temples, we participate in sacred ordinances and make covenants with Heavenly Father that bind us to Him and to our Savior. These covenants and ordinances prepare us to return to Heavenly Father\u2019s presence and to be sealed together as families for eternity.\n\n\nIn the temple, great blessings are also made available to God\u2019s faithful children in this life. In temple covenants and ordinances, \u201cthe power of godliness is manifest\u201d (\nDoctrine and Covenants 84:20\n). The temple is a holy place where members can worship, learn, and receive guidance and comfort (see \nDoctrine and Covenants 109:13\u201316\n). Those who attend the temple can have access to God\u2019s power to help accomplish His work (see \nDoctrine and Covenants 109:22\u201323\n; see also \n3.5\n in this handbook).\n\n\nTemple covenants and ordinances are sacred. The symbols associated with temple covenants should not be discussed outside the temple. Nor should we discuss the holy information we promise in the temple not to reveal. However, we may discuss the basic purposes and doctrine of temple covenants and ordinances and the spiritual feelings we have in the temple.\n\n\nWard and stake leaders discuss the information in this chapter with members who are preparing to receive the endowment or sealing ordinances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.1\n\n\nReceiving Temple Ordinances\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.1.1\n\n\nPreparing to Receive Temple Ordinances\n\n\n\n\nMembers should prepare themselves spiritually to receive temple ordinances and to make and honor temple covenants.\n\n\nParents have the primary responsibility to help their children prepare to receive temple ordinances. Stake and ward leaders, ministering brothers and sisters, and extended family members support parents in this role.\n\n\nStake and ward leaders regularly encourage members to prepare to receive their own temple ordinances. Leaders also emphasize the importance of honoring temple covenants and remaining worthy of and having a temple recommend.\n\n\nResources to help members prepare to receive temple ordinances are available at \ntemples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\n\n\nMembers who are preparing to receive their own endowment or to be sealed to a spouse are encouraged to participate in a temple preparation course (see \n25.2.8\n).\n\n\nMembers meet with their bishop and stake president to obtain a recommend for living ordinances when they are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceiving their own endowment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing sealed to a spouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor information about issuing temple recommends in these circumstances, see \n26.1\n and \n26.3.1\n.\n\n\n \n \nImage\nchildren in white clothing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.1.2\n\n\nScheduling Temple Ordinances\n\n\n\n\nMembers who are planning to receive their own endowment or to be sealed or married should schedule the ordinance in advance with the temple they plan to attend. See \ntemples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n for each temple\u2019s contact information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.1.3\n\n\nMembers Who Have Physical Disabilities\n\n\n\n\nWorthy members who have physical disabilities may receive all temple ordinances (see \n38.2.5\n). These members are encouraged to attend the temple with endowed relatives or friends of the same gender who can assist them. Those who assist must have a current temple recommend. If members cannot attend with a family member or friend, they may call the temple in advance to see what arrangements can be made. See \ntemples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n for each temple\u2019s contact information.\n\n\nService animals and emotional support animals are not allowed in temples. Stake presidents may contact the Temple Department at \nTempleDepartment@ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n if they have questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.1.4\n\n\nTranslation or Interpretation Assistance\n\n\n\n\nIf members need translation or interpretation assistance, they should contact the temple in advance to see if it is available. See \ntemples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n for each temple\u2019s contact information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.1.5\n\n\nClothing to Wear to a Temple\n\n\n\n\nWhen going to a temple, members should wear the type of clothing they typically wear to sacrament meeting. They should avoid wearing clothing that is casual or that does not cover the temple garment. They should also avoid wearing clothing that is overly formal, like tuxedos. This instruction is best taught by parents, ministering brothers and sisters, and ward and stake leaders as members prepare to worship in the temple.\n\n\nSee \n27.3.2.6\n for information about clothing to wear to a temple marriage or sealing.\n\n\nSee \n38.5\n for information about:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClothing to wear during the endowment and sealing ordinances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObtaining, wearing, and caring for ceremonial temple clothing and garments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.1.6\n\n\nChild Care\n\n\n\n\nChildren must have adult supervision if they are on temple grounds. Temple workers are available to supervise children only in the following circumstances:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf they are being sealed to parents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf they are observing the sealing of their living siblings, stepsiblings, or half siblings to their parents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.1.7\n\n\nMeeting with Members after They Receive Temple Ordinances\n\n\n\n\nMembers often have questions after receiving temple ordinances. Endowed family members, the bishop, other ward leaders, and ministering brothers and sisters may meet with members to discuss their temple experience.\n\n\nLeaders also encourage members to seek answers to their questions through the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. In the temple, the Spirit can provide answers to many of the questions that members may have about their temple experience.\n\n\nResources to help answer questions are available at \ntemples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.2\n\n\nThe Endowment\n\n\n\n\nThe word \nendowment\n means \u201ca gift.\u201d The temple endowment is literally a gift from God through which He blesses His children. The endowment can be received only in holy temples. Some of the gifts that members receive through the temple endowment include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreater knowledge of the Lord\u2019s purposes and teachings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower to do all that Heavenly Father wants His children to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDivine direction when serving the Lord, their families, and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased hope, comfort, and peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the promised blessings of the endowment are in force both in this life and for eternity. The fulfillment of these blessings depends on faithfulness to the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\n\nThe endowment is received in two parts. In the first part, a person receives preliminary ordinances called the initiatory. The initiatory comprises three ordinances: washing, anointing, and clothing (see \nExodus 29:4\u20139\n). It includes special blessings related to the person\u2019s divine heritage and potential.\n\n\nDuring the initiatory, the member covenants to wear the temple garment. The garment represents his or her personal relationship with God and the commitment to obey covenants made in the temple. When members are faithful to their covenants and wear the garment properly throughout their lives, it also serves as a protection. For information about wearing and caring for the garment, see \n38.5.5\n.\n\n\nIn the second part of the endowment, the plan of salvation is taught, including the Creation, the Fall of Adam and Eve, the Atonement of Jesus Christ, the Apostasy, and the Restoration. Members also receive instruction on how to return to the Lord\u2019s presence.\n\n\nIn the endowment, members are invited to make sacred covenants as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive the law of obedience and strive to keep Heavenly Father\u2019s commandments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObey the law of sacrifice, which means sacrificing to support the Lord\u2019s work and repenting with a broken heart and contrite spirit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObey the law of the gospel of Jesus Christ, which means:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercising faith in Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepenting daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking covenants with God by receiving the ordinances of salvation and exaltation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnduring to the end by keeping covenants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStriving to live the two great commandments. These are to \u201clove the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind\u201d and to \u201clove thy neighbor as thyself\u201d (\nMatthew 22:37,\u00a039\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep the law of chastity, which means abstaining from sexual relations outside of a legal marriage between a man and a woman, which is according to God\u2019s law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep the law of consecration, which means that members dedicate their time, talents, and everything with which the Lord has blessed them to building up Jesus Christ\u2019s Church on the earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn return, Heavenly Father promises that those who remain faithful to their temple covenants will be endowed \u201cwith power from on high\u201d (\nDoctrine and Covenants 38:32,\u00a038\n; see also \nLuke 24:49\n; \nDoctrine and Covenants 43:16\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.2.1\n\n\nWho May Receive the Endowment\n\n\n\n\nAll accountable adult members of the Church are invited to prepare for and receive their own endowment. All prerequisite ordinances must be performed and recorded before members can receive the endowment (see \n26.3.1\n). See \n27.2.2\n for information about deciding when to receive the endowment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.2.1.1\n\n\nNewly Baptized Members\n\n\n\n\nWorthy adult new members may receive their endowment at least one full year from the date of their confirmation (see \n26.5.2\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.2.1.2\n\n\nMembers Who Have an Unendowed Spouse\n\n\n\n\nA worthy member whose spouse is unendowed may receive his or her own endowment when the following conditions are met:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unendowed spouse gives his or her consent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe member, bishop, and stake president are confident that the responsibility assumed with temple covenants will not be a disruption to the marriage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese conditions apply whether the spouse is a member of the Church or is not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.2.1.3\n\n\nMembers Who Have Intellectual Disabilities\n\n\n\n\nMembers who have intellectual disabilities may receive their own endowment if:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have received all prerequisite ordinances (see \n26.3.1\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have the intellectual capacity to understand, make, and keep the associated covenants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop counsels with the member and, where applicable, his or her parents. He also seeks the direction of the Spirit. He may counsel with the stake president. The stake president may direct questions to the Office of the First Presidency if necessary. See \n38.2.4\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.2.2\n\n\nDeciding When to Receive the Endowment\n\n\n\n\nThe decision to receive the endowment is personal and should be made prayerfully. The endowment is a blessing of power and revelation to all who prepare to receive it. Members may choose to receive their own endowment when they meet all of the following conditions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are at least 18\u00a0years old.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have completed or are no longer attending high school, secondary school, or the equivalent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne full year has passed since their confirmation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey feel a desire to receive and honor sacred temple covenants throughout their lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers who have received a mission call or are preparing to be sealed in the temple should receive the endowment. The bishop also counsels with other adult members who desire to receive the endowment.\n\n\nBefore issuing a temple recommend for a member to receive the endowment, the bishop and stake president should feel that the person is prepared to understand and keep sacred temple covenants. This eligibility is determined individually for each person. Leaders do not use generalized criteria, such as those listed below, when determining whether a person is prepared to receive the endowment:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaching a certain age\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaving home for college, employment, or military service\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesiring to observe the temple sealing of a family member or friend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.2.3\n\n\nPlanning and Scheduling the Endowment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.2.3.1\n\n\nReceiving a Recommend for Living Ordinances\n\n\n\n\nA member must receive a recommend for living ordinances to enter a temple and receive the endowment. For information about these recommends, see \n26.5.1\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.2.3.2\n\n\nContacting the Temple\n\n\n\n\nMembers who are planning to receive the endowment should contact the temple in advance to schedule the ordinance (see \n27.1.2\n). The temple will provide instructions, including information about temple clothing, when the appointment is scheduled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.2.3.3\n\n\nEscorts for Members Receiving the Endowment\n\n\n\n\nMembers receiving their own endowment may invite an endowed member of the same gender to act as an escort and assist them during the endowment session. An escort must have a current temple recommend. The temple can provide an escort if needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.3\n\n\nSealing of Husband and Wife\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe family is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan\u201d (\u201c\nThe Family: A Proclamation to the World\n\u201d). A temple sealing joins a husband and wife together for time and all eternity. Couples who are sealed in the temple are promised glory and joy throughout eternity (see \nDoctrine and Covenants 132:19\u201320\n). They will receive these blessings if they are faithful to the covenants they make in the temple. Through this ordinance, their children may also be part of their eternal family.\n\n\nChurch leaders encourage members to prepare to be married and sealed in a temple. Where temple marriages are not legally recognized, authorized Church leaders or others can perform civil marriages that are followed by a temple sealing (see \n38.3\n). This pattern may also be followed when a temple marriage could cause parents or immediate family members to feel excluded because they cannot attend the temple ceremony.\n\n\n \n \nImage\nfamily outside temple\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.3.1\n\n\nWho May Be Sealed in a Temple\n\n\n\n\nAll accountable unmarried members of the Church are invited to prepare for a temple sealing. Those who are civilly married are encouraged to be sealed for time and eternity in the temple as soon as they are prepared. Members must be endowed before they can be sealed (see \n27.2\n).\n\n\nCouples being sealed in the temple must be either (1)\u00a0married civilly before being sealed or (2)\u00a0married and sealed in the same temple ceremony. See \n27.3.2\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.3.1.1\n\n\nMembers Who Were Sealed to a Previous Spouse\n\n\n\n\nSee \n38.4.1\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.3.1.2\n\n\nMembers Who Have Intellectual Disabilities\n\n\n\n\nMembers who have intellectual disabilities may be sealed to their spouse, fianc\u00e9, or fianc\u00e9e if:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have received all prerequisite ordinances, including the endowment (see \n27.2.1.3\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have the intellectual capacity to understand, make, and keep the associated covenants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop counsels with the member and his or her spouse, fianc\u00e9, or fianc\u00e9e. He also seeks the direction of the Spirit. He may counsel with the stake president. The stake president may direct questions to the Office of the First Presidency if necessary. See \n38.2.4\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.3.2\n\n\nPlanning and Scheduling a Temple Marriage or Sealing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.3.2.1\n\n\nReceiving a Recommend for Living Ordinances\n\n\n\n\nA member must receive a recommend for living ordinances to be sealed to his or her spouse. For information about these recommends, see \n26.3\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.3.2.2\n\n\nContacting the Temple\n\n\n\n\nMembers who are planning to be married or sealed to a spouse should contact the temple in advance to schedule the ordinance (see \n27.1.2\n). The temple will provide instructions when the appointment is scheduled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.3.2.3\n\n\nObtaining a Marriage License\n\n\n\n\nBefore being married, a couple must obtain a legal marriage license that is valid where the marriage will be performed. If the couple plans to be both married and sealed during the same ceremony, they must bring a valid marriage license to the temple.\n\n\nCouples being sealed after a civil marriage do not need to bring a marriage license to the temple. Instead, they provide the date and location of their civil marriage as part of the record verification process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.3.2.4\n\n\nEscorts for the Bride and Groom\n\n\n\n\nAn endowed sister may accompany the bride to assist her in the dressing room. An endowed brother may do the same for the groom. An escort must have a current temple recommend. The temple can provide an escort if needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.3.2.5\n\n\nWho Performs a Temple Marriage or Sealing\n\n\n\n\nA temple marriage or sealing is usually performed by a sealer who is assigned to the temple where the couple will be married or sealed. If a family member or acquaintance holds the sealing authority and is assigned to the temple where the couple will be married or sealed, they may invite him to perform the marriage or sealing.\n\n\nA sealer may also seek First Presidency approval to perform a sealing for his lineal descendants (children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren) in a temple other than the one to which he is assigned. He must receive a letter of authorization from the First Presidency for each such sealing. He presents the letter at the temple.\n\n\nMembers are discouraged from asking General Authorities to perform their temple marriage or sealing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.3.2.6\n\n\nAppropriate Clothing for a Temple Marriage or Sealing\n\n\n\n\nBride\u2019s Dress.\n A bride\u2019s dress worn in the temple should be white, modest in design and fabric, and free of elaborate ornamentation. It also should cover the temple garment. Sheer fabric should be lined.\n\n\nTo be consistent with other dresses worn in the temple, a bride\u2019s dress should have long sleeves or three-quarter sleeves. Dresses should not have a train unless it can be pinned up or removed for the sealing ceremony.\n\n\nThe temple can provide a dress if needed or desired.\n\n\nGroom\u2019s Clothing.\n The groom wears normal temple clothing during the marriage or sealing ceremony (see \n38.5.1\n and \n38.5.2\n). He may wear formal clothing outside the temple for photographs after the ceremony.\n\n\nGuests\u2019 Clothing.\n Those who attend a marriage or sealing ceremony should wear clothing similar to what they would wear to a sacrament meeting. Members who come to a sealing directly from an endowment session may wear ceremonial temple clothing.\n\n\nThe couple should share this information with guests well before the marriage or sealing.\n\n\nFlowers. \nThe couple and their guests should not wear flowers during the marriage or sealing ceremony. Flowers may be worn outside the temple for photographs after the ceremony. The couple should share this information with guests well before the marriage or sealing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.3.2.7\n\n\nExchanging Rings after a Temple Marriage or Sealing\n\n\n\n\nExchanging rings is not part of the temple sealing ceremony. However, couples may exchange rings after the ceremony in the sealing room. Couples should not exchange rings at any other time or place in a temple or on temple grounds. Doing so can detract from the ceremony.\n\n\nCouples who are married and sealed in the same ceremony may exchange rings at a later time to accommodate family members who are unable to attend a temple marriage. The ring exchange should be consistent with the dignity of a temple marriage. The exchange should not replicate any part of the temple marriage or sealing ceremony. The couple should not exchange vows after being married or sealed in the temple.\n\n\nCouples who are married civilly before their temple sealing may exchange rings at their civil ceremony, at their temple sealing, or at both ceremonies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.3.3\n\n\nMarriage in a Temple for Time Only\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the temple is to administer ordinances for eternity. For this reason, marriages for time only are no longer performed in temples.\n\n\nFor the policy on sealing a couple who were married in the temple for time only, see \n38.4.1.6\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.3.4\n\n\nWho May Attend a Temple Marriage or Sealing\n\n\n\n\nCouples should invite only close family members and friends to a temple marriage or sealing. Accountable members must be endowed and have a current temple recommend to attend.\n\n\nSome members of record are not baptized due to an intellectual disability, and some are baptized but not endowed for the same reason. The stake president may authorize them to observe the temple marriage or sealing of their living siblings if they:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre at least 18\u00a0years old.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre able to remain reverent during the ceremony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stake president writes a letter stating that the person is authorized to observe the sealing. This letter is presented at the temple.\n\n\nMembers must be endowed and have a current temple recommend to observe the sealing of their parents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.3.5\n\n\nWedding Receptions\n\n\n\n\nSee \n38.3.4\n for information about holding wedding receptions in Church buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.4\n\n\nSealing Living Children to Parents\n\n\n\n\nChildren who are born after their mother has been sealed to a husband in a temple are born in the covenant of that sealing. They do not need to receive the ordinance of sealing to parents.\n\n\nChildren who are not born in the covenant can become part of an eternal family by being sealed to their birth or adoptive parents. These children are entitled to the same blessings as those who were born in the covenant.\n\n\nSee \n38.4.2\n for policies about sealing children to parents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.4.1\n\n\nIssuing a Recommend for Sealing Living Children to Parents\n\n\n\n\nAccountable members ages\u00a08 and older need a recommend to be sealed to their parents. They also need a recommend to observe the sealing of living siblings, stepsiblings, or half siblings to their parents (see \n27.4.4\n). Children ages\u00a08 and older must be baptized and confirmed in order to receive a temple recommend. Males who are at least\u00a011 and turning\u00a012 during the year of the ordinance must also hold the priesthood.\n\n\nMembers who are\u00a021 or older must be endowed and have a current temple recommend to be sealed to their parents.\n\n\nThe stake president may authorize persons who have not been baptized or endowed due to intellectual disabilities to be sealed to their parents.
