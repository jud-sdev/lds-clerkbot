Caring for those who have temporal needs is part of God\u2019s work of salvation and exaltation (see \n1.2\n).\n\n\nChurch members are also counseled to strengthen their own self-reliance through diligent work and with the help of the Lord. Self-reliance is the ability, commitment, and effort to provide the spiritual and temporal necessities of life for self and family. As members become more self-reliant, they are also better able to serve others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY EFFORTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.1\n\n\nBuild Self-Reliance\n\n\n\n\nWith help from the Lord, members build self-reliance in the following ways:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop spiritual, physical, and emotional strength.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGain education and employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprove temporal preparedness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.1.1\n\n\nSpiritual Strength\n\n\n\n\nThe Savior taught that \u201call things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal\u201d (\nDoctrine and Covenants 29:34\n). Members develop spiritual strength as they exercise faith in Christ and obey God\u2019s commandments.\n\n\nAs they do so, they receive guidance from the Holy Spirit on how to solve their problems and minister to others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.1.2\n\n\nPhysical and Emotional Health\n\n\n\n\nHeavenly Father wants His children to develop physical and emotional strength. This includes doing the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObey the Word of Wisdom (see \nDoctrine and Covenants\u00a089\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrive to eat nutritious food, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid substances and behaviors that are harmful or addictive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice good hygiene and receive proper medical care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelop healthy relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeek professional help for mental or emotional health challenges as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nImage\ncouple jogging\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.1.3\n\n\nEducation and Employment\n\n\n\n\nThe Savior taught, \u201cSeek learning, even by study and also by faith\u201d (\nDoctrine and Covenants 88:118\n). Education or vocational training can lead to better employment so members can provide for personal and family needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.1.4\n\n\nTemporal Preparedness\n\n\n\n\nMembers are counseled to become prepared so they can care for themselves, their families, and others in times of need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Elements of Temporal Preparedness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinances\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPay tithes and offerings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimize debt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive within a budget\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave for the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObtain an appropriate education\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Storage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther necessities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers increase their financial preparedness by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaying tithes and offerings (see \nMalachi 3:8\u201312\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimizing debt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving within a budget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving for the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObtaining an appropriate education (see \n22.3.3\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparedness also includes planning for emergencies. Members are encouraged to build both a short-term and longer-term supply of food, water, and other necessities.\n\n\nFor more information, see \nPersonal Finances for Self-Reliance\n and \u201c\nTemporal Preparedness Resources\n.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.2\n\n\nMinister to Those with Temporal and Emotional Needs\n\n\n\n\nThe Lord\u2019s disciples are taught to \u201clove \u2026 and to serve one another\u201d and to \u201csuccor those that stand in need of \u2026 succor\u201d (\nMosiah 4:15\u201316\n). Members strive to minister to those who have temporal and emotional needs. These needs may include food, clothing, housing, education, employment, physical health, and emotional well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.2.1\n\n\nThe Lord\u2019s Storehouse\n\n\n\n\nAll the resources available to the Church to help those with temporal needs are called the Lord\u2019s storehouse (see \nDoctrine and Covenants 82:18\u201319\n). These include members\u2019 offerings of time, talents, compassion, materials, and financial resources to help those in need.\n\n\nThe Lord\u2019s storehouse exists in each ward and stake. Leaders can often help individuals and families find solutions to their needs by drawing on the knowledge, skills, and service offered by ward and stake members.\n\n\n \n \nImage\nman teaching young man carpentry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.2.2\n\n\nThe Law of the Fast and Fast Offerings\n\n\n\n\nThe Lord has established the law of the fast to bless His people and to provide a way for them to serve those in need. Members grow closer to the Lord and increase in spiritual strength as they live the law of the fast. They also strengthen their own self-reliance and develop greater compassion. (See \nIsaiah 58:6\u201312\n; \nMalachi 3:8\u201312\n.)\n\n\nFasting may be done at any time. However, members usually observe the first Sabbath of the month as a fast day. A fast day typically includes the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPraying\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing without food and drink for a 24-hour period (if physically able)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiving a generous fast offering\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA fast offering is a donation to help those in need. When members fast, they are invited to give an offering that is at least equal to the value of the meals not eaten. Members are encouraged to be generous and give more than the value of these meals if they can.\n\n\nMembers may give their fast offering and a completed Tithing and Other Offerings form to the bishop or one of his counselors. In some areas, they can also make their \ndonation online\n. \n \n \n In some wards, the bishop may authorize Aaronic Priesthood holders to collect fast offerings (see \n34.3.2\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.2.3\n\n\nService\n\n\n\n\nMembers seek to serve others as the Savior did (see \nJohn 13:35\n).\n\n\nService can be coordinated in the ward, stake, or community. Where \nJustServe.org\n is available, members and others can use it to identify service opportunities in the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.2.4\n\n\nHumanitarian Aid\n\n\n\n\nThe Church provides humanitarian aid throughout the world. It does this both directly and through collaboration with other relief organizations. \n \n \n Members and others who wish to support these efforts may donate to Church humanitarian aid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEADER EFFORTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.3\n\n\nPattern for Building Self-Reliance and Ministering to Those in Need\n\n\n\n\nChurch leaders represent the Savior as they care for those with temporal and emotional needs (see \n22.3.4\n). In doing so, they strive to help members strengthen their self-reliance.\n\n\nLeaders seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost so they can assist with sensitivity and compassion. The following pattern will help leaders address members\u2019 needs in a way that builds self-reliance:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeek out those in need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp them assess and address short-term needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp them build long-term self-reliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister to those with emotional needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.3.1\n\n\nSeek Out Those in Need\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop has a sacred responsibility to seek out and care for those in need (see \nDoctrine and Covenants 84:112\n). Others who have an important role in this responsibility include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinistering brothers and sisters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelief Society and elders quorum presidencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop\u2019s counselors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther members of the ward council.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs needed, the bishopric may call ward welfare and self-reliance specialists to support these efforts (see \n22.6.4\n).\n\n\nIn a spirit of love and concern, ward leaders help identify members who may need assistance. It is not enough to assist only when asked. Leaders should counsel with ministering brothers and sisters to ensure that members in need receive proper care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.3.2\n\n\nHelp Members Assess and Address Short-Term Needs\n\n\n\n\nMembers strive to meet their basic needs through their own efforts and help from extended family. When this is insufficient, members may need help from other sources such as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment and community resources (see \n22.12\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChurch assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChurch assistance might include help with short-term needs such as food, clothing, housing, or other basics. Bishops may use fast offerings to respond to these needs. \n \n \n Where bishops\u2019 orders are available, bishops generally use those to provide food and other basic goods (see \u201c\nBishops\u2019 Orders and Referrals\n\u201d in Leader and Clerk Resources [LCR]).\n\n\nWhen providing Church assistance, leaders follow the principles and policies outlined in sections \n22.4\n and \n22.5\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.3.3\n\n\nHelp Members Build Long-Term Self-Reliance\n\n\n\n\nMembers may need ongoing support to address longer-term challenges. Education, vocational training, or other resources can help them build self-reliance and provide for their longer-term needs. Relief Society and elders quorum leaders, ministering brothers and sisters, and others can help members gain access to these resources.\n\n\nThe \nSelf-Reliance Plan\n helps members identify their strengths, needs, and resources. This plan should be used each time Church assistance is considered. The bishop may assign Relief Society leaders, elders quorum leaders, ministering brothers and sisters, or others to help members fill out the plan.\n\n\nAs part of a self-reliance plan, leaders may recommend that members participate in a \nself-reliance group\n. These groups help them develop skills and resources for better education, employment, or financial management (see \n22.13\n). The groups are generally organized by stake or ward councils (see \n22.10.2\n, \n22.7\n).\n\n\nThe bishop, or another leader he assigns, uses the \nBishop\u2019s Guide to the Self-Reliance Plan\n when providing assistance. This form helps leaders follow up on members\u2019 progress toward self-reliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.3.4\n\n\nMinister to Those with Emotional Needs\n\n\n\n\nMinistering brothers and sisters and ward leaders can be instrumental in helping members who experience emotional challenges. A person\u2019s struggle with emotional challenges can also affect family members, especially his or her spouse. Ward leaders should extend support and understanding to them.\n\n\nThe Church provides \u201c\nCounseling Resources\n\u201d to help leaders support members on a wide range of emotional and social issues. Additional resources for members include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding Strength in the Lord: Emotional Resilience\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealing through the Savior: The Addiction Recovery Program\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpouse and family support groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourses for strengthening marriages and families\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBishops may consult with Family Services staff to better understand a member\u2019s emotional challenges and to identify available resources. Stake and mission presidents may also consult with Family Services. Family Services staff can help these leaders evaluate if a member with serious emotional or social challenges may need professional counseling. Leaders can request a consultation by contacting their Family Services office or their welfare and self-reliance manager. (See\u00a0\n31.3.6\n for contact information.)\n\n\n \n \n Bishops can refer members who need counseling to a Family Services professional, where available. They do this by using a bishop\u2019s order for services (see \u201c\nBishops\u2019 Orders and Referrals\n\u201d in LCR). Alternatively, members may seek help from reputable professional counselors in the community.\n\n\nSometimes bishops counsel members who need help to repent of sinful behavior. This behavior may include sins related to or caused by addictions. In these situations, bishops should refer to the guidelines in \n32.8.1\n and \n32.8.2\n.\n\n\n \n \nImage\ncouple looking at papers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.4\n\n\nPrinciples for Providing Church Assistance\n\n\n\n\nWith the help of the Lord, members seek to provide for themselves and their families. Extended families are encouraged to help as needed. When members need additional assistance, they may turn to other sources. These may include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment and community resources (see \n22.12\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChurch assistance through fast offerings or bishops\u2019 orders for food and other basic goods (see \n22.3.2\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChurch assistance is intended to help members develop independence, not dependence. Any assistance given should strengthen members in their efforts to become self-reliant.\n\n\nWhen providing Church assistance, leaders follow the principles in sections \n22.4.1 through 22.4.5\n. Bishoprics and clerks are encouraged to review the video \u201c\nSacred Funds, Sacred Responsibilities\n.\u201d\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples for Providing Church Assistance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEncourage personal and family responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide temporary assistance for essential needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide resources or services rather than cash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffer work or service opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep information about Church assistance confidential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.4.1\n\n\nEncourage Personal and Family Responsibility\n\n\n\n\nLeaders teach that individuals and families have the primary responsibility for their own well-being. By living principles of self-reliance, members will be better able to solve future needs on their own (see \n22.1\n).\n\n\nBefore providing Church assistance, the bishop (or another leader or member he assigns) reviews with members what resources they are using to meet their own needs. This person may suggest other resources for the members to consider, including resources in the government or community (see \n22.12\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.4.2\n\n\nProvide Temporary Assistance for Essential Needs\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of Church assistance is to temporarily meet basic needs while members strive to become self-reliant. Fast-offering assistance is generally used to pay for essential items, such as food and clothing. However, it may also be used to pay for housing, utilities, or personal services such as counseling, medical care, or short-term skills training.\n\n\nChurch assistance is meant to sustain life\u2014not to maintain lifestyle. Members may need support and empathy as they work to reduce or eliminate expenses.\n\n\nBishops should exercise good judgment and seek spiritual direction when considering the amount and duration of the assistance given. They should be compassionate and generous while not creating dependence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.4.3\n\n\nProvide Resources or Services Rather Than Cash\n\n\n\n\nIf possible, the bishop should avoid giving cash. Instead, he should use fast offerings or bishops\u2019 orders to provide members with groceries or services. Members can then use their own money to pay for other needs.\n\n\nWhen this is not sufficient, the bishop may assist by using fast offerings to temporarily pay essential bills (see \n22.5.2\n). If possible, these payments should be sent directly to the service provider (see \n22.5.3\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.4.4\n\n\nOffer Work or Service Opportunities\n\n\n\n\nBishops invite those who receive assistance to work or provide service to the extent of their ability. This helps members maintain a sense of dignity. It also increases their ability to be self-reliant.\n\n\nSome members who are elderly or disabled may be limited in the work or service they can provide. Leaders should understand their situations and offer options that allow them to do what they can within their circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.4.5\n\n\nKeep Information about Church Assistance Confidential\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop and other ward leaders keep confidential any information about members who may need Church assistance. This protects members\u2019 privacy and dignity. (See \n31.3\n.)\n\n\nMembers who receive assistance should recognize the sacred nature of fast offerings and bishops\u2019 orders. They should treat any assistance they receive with confidentiality and respect.\n\n\nSometimes it may be helpful for the ward council or others to know about the needs of an individual or family. An example is when a member is looking for a job. In these cases, the bishop and other leaders generally seek the member\u2019s permission to share such information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.5\n\n\nPolicies for Providing Church Assistance\n\n\n\n\nChurch leaders should follow the policies outlined in this section when providing assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.5.1\n\n\nPolicies Regarding Recipients of Church Assistance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.5.1.1\n\n\nAssistance to Ward Members\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, members who receive Church assistance should live in the ward boundaries and have their membership record in the ward. Assistance can be given regardless of whether the member regularly attends Church meetings or follows Church standards.\n\n\nIf a member recently moved into the ward, the bishop contacts the previous bishop to discuss the person\u2019s situation before providing assistance. Bishops can also review any assistance given during the previous three years in the \u201c\nFinance\n\u201d section of \nLCR\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.5.1.2\n\n\nAssistance to Bishops and Stake Presidents\n\n\n\n\nAt times a bishop or members of his immediate or extended family who live in the ward may need Church assistance. When this occurs, the bishop reviews the needs and the proposed assistance with the stake president. The stake president\u2019s written approval is required before a bishop may use fast offerings or approve a bishop\u2019s order for himself or his family.\n\n\nIf fast-offering funds are used, the stake president reviews the bills and other expenses before authorizing payment. The bishop may not approve a payment for himself or his family.\n\n\nWhen a stake president or members of his immediate or extended family who live in his ward need assistance, he contacts the bishop. The bishop follows the same principles and guidelines of Church assistance that he would for any other member. However, once the bishop has approved the request, the stake president must submit it to the Area Presidency. The stake president and bishop await written approval from a member of the Area Presidency before proceeding with the payment or order. (If a district president needs assistance, approval is sought from the mission president rather than the Area Presidency.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.5.1.3\n\n\nAssistance to Persons Who Are Transient or Homeless\n\n\n\n\nBishops may assist members and others who are transient or homeless. However, they carefully consider the type and amount of assistance given. They are encouraged to counsel with the bishop of the person\u2019s previous ward before giving assistance.\n\n\nBishops generally invite transient or homeless members who receive assistance to accept work or service opportunities. Bishops may also refer these members to community resources that are equipped to address their needs.\n\n\nBased on need, a stake president may appoint one bishop to handle all requests arising in the stake from people who are transient or homeless. In some areas there is a concentration of stakes with large numbers of people who are transient or homeless. In those situations, the Area Presidency may call a service missionary to handle their requests for assistance. This person should have served as a bishop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.5.1.4\n\n\nAssistance to Persons Who Are Not Members of the Church\n\n\n\n\nPersons who are not members of the Church are usually referred to local community resources for assistance. On rare occasions, as guided by the Spirit, the bishop may assist them with fast offerings or bishops\u2019 orders. For instance, the bishop may consider assistance for parents or caretakers who are not Church members but have one or more children who are members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.5.2\n\n\nPolicies on Using Fast Offerings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.5.2.1\n\n\nMedical or Other Health Care\n\n\n\n\nEach Church area has established approval limits for using fast offerings to pay medical, dental, or mental health expenses. Limits may vary by region or country in an area.\n\n\nWhen bishops use fast offerings to help pay for medical, dental, or mental health care, they should not exceed these limits without appropriate approval. For approval amounts and guidelines, see \u201c\nUse of Fast Offerings for Medical Expenses\n.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.5.2.2\n\n\nConsumer Debt and Failed Businesses or Investments\n\n\n\n\nFast offerings may not be used to pay consumer debt, such as credit cards or personal loans. Nor may fast offerings be used to pay money owed as a result of a failed business or investment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.5.2.3\n\n\nRepayment of Fast Offerings\n\n\n\n\nMembers do not repay fast-offering assistance they receive from the Church.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.5.2.4\n\n\nWard Fast-Offering Expenditure Amounts\n\n\n\n\nBishops are not required to limit fast-offering assistance for ward members to the amount of donations collected within the ward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.5.3\n\n\nPolicies on Making Payments\n\n\n\n\nIf possible, payments should be made directly to the businesses that provide goods and services. Payments are not typically made to the person being assisted.\n\n\nBishopric members and clerks follow the financial procedures outlined in \n34.5.7\n when:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing a check.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing an electronic disbursement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithdrawing cash for a fast-offering payment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.5.4\n\n\nPolicies on Payments That Would Benefit a Bishop or Stake President\n\n\n\n\nWhen providing members with fast-offering assistance, a bishop may not use the funds to pay for goods or services in a way that would benefit him personally. Any exception would require approval from the stake president. For example, if the bishop owns the rental property where a member lives, he may not use fast offerings to pay that member\u2019s rent unless the stake president first gives approval.\n\n\nIf a fast-offering payment for a member would benefit the stake president or a business he owns, Area Presidency approval is required. Once the bishop approves the proposed payment, the stake president submits the request to the Area Presidency. The stake president and bishop await written approval from a member of the Area Presidency before proceeding with the payment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.5.5\n\n\nProtecting against Improper Use of Funds\n\n\n\n\nBishoprics and clerks should protect fast-offering funds from improper use. For questions or to report abuse of Church assistance or fraud, members of bishoprics or clerks in the United States and Canada can call the help line at 1-800-453-3860, extension 2-7887. Members of bishoprics or clerks outside the United States and Canada should call their area office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.6\n\n\nRoles of Ward Leaders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.6.1\n\n\nBishop and His Counselors\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop has a divine mandate to seek out and care for those with temporal needs (see \nDoctrine and Covenants 84:112\n). He delegates much of this work to the Relief Society and elders quorum presidencies. However, certain duties are performed only by the bishop. For example, the bishop:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermines the type, amount, and duration of any temporal assistance provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproves fast-offering assistance (see \n22.4\n and \n22.5\n) and bishops\u2019 orders (see \n22.13\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsures that the principles and policies for providing temporal assistance are followed (see \n22.4\n and \n22.5\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonally reviews members\u2019 self-reliance plans. He assigns other ward leaders to follow up on those plans as needed. (See the \nSelf-Reliance Plan\n and \nBishop\u2019s Guide to the Self-Reliance Plan\n.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bishop and his counselors have the following responsibilities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeach the principles and blessings related to (1)\u00a0caring for those who have temporal and emotional needs and (2)\u00a0building self-reliance (see \n22.1\n). This includes personal and family preparedness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeach the law of the fast and encourage members to give a generous fast offering (see \n22.2.2\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOversee the gathering and accounting of fast offerings (see \n34.3.2\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the presidency of the Aaronic Priesthood, the bishopric also oversees the efforts of Aaronic Priesthood quorums and Young Women classes to serve those with temporal needs in the ward and community (see \n10.2.2\n and \n11.2.2\n). These efforts are coordinated in ward youth council meetings (see \n22.8\n) and in quorum and class presidency meetings (see \n10.4.3\n and \n11.3.4.3\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.6.2\n\n\nRelief Society and Elders Quorum Presidencies\n\n\n\n\nUnder the direction of the bishop, the Relief Society and elders quorum presidencies have a key role in caring for those in need in the ward (see \n8.2.2\n and \n9.2.2\n). These leaders teach ward members to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister to those in need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive the law of the fast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild self-reliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncrease personal and family preparedness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n In some locations, bishops have the option to provide members in need with a bishop\u2019s order for food and other basic goods (see \n22.13\n). The bishop generally assigns the Relief Society president to meet with the members and fill out the order form (see \n9.2.2.2\n). However, he may also assign the elders quorum president (see \n8.2.2.2\n). A counselor in the Relief Society or elders quorum presidency may be assigned if the president is unavailable. The assigned leader submits the completed form to the bishop for his approval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.6.3\n\n\nMinistering Brothers or Sisters\n\n\n\n\nAssistance with spiritual and temporal needs often begins with ministering brothers and sisters (see \n21.1\n). They report the needs of those whom they serve to their elders quorum or Relief Society presidencies in ministering interviews and at other times. They may share needs that are confidential directly with the bishop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.6.4\n\n\nImage\nicon, optional resources\n Ward Welfare and Self-Reliance Specialists\n\n\n\n\nBishoprics may call individuals or couples as ward welfare and self-reliance specialists. These specialists support ward leaders in their efforts to care for others and help them become more self-reliant.\n\n\nSpecialists may be assigned to specific areas of focus. These could include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparedness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmotional health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNutrition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal finances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBishoprics may also ask specialists to help coordinate or facilitate \nself-reliance groups\n. These groups are generally organized by stake or ward councils.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.6.5\n\n\nSummary of Callings and Roles\n\n\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the callings and roles discussed in \n22.6\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalling\n\n\n\n\nVisit and Assess Needs\n\n\n\n\nTeach Principles of Self-Reliance\n\n\n\n\nAssist Members with the Self-Reliance Plan\n\n\n\n\nApprove Fast-Offering Assistance or Bishops\u2019 Orders\n\n\n\n\nCalling\n\n\n\n\nBishop\n\n\n\n\nVisit and Assess Needs\n\n\n\n\nMay, but often delegates\n\n\n\n\nTeach Principles of Self-Reliance\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nAssist Members with the Self-Reliance Plan\n\n\n\n\nMay, but often delegates\n\n\n\n\nApprove Fast-Offering Assistance or Bishops\u2019 Orders\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nCalling\n\n\n\n\nRelief Society and elders quorum presidencies\n\n\n\n\nVisit and Assess Needs\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nTeach Principles of Self-Reliance\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nAssist Members with the Self-Reliance Plan\n\n\n\n\nAs assigned\n\n\n\n\nApprove Fast-Offering Assistance or Bishops\u2019 Orders\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nCalling\n\n\n\n\nMinistering brothers and sisters\n\n\n\n\nVisit and Assess Needs\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nTeach Principles of Self-Reliance\n\n\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\nAssist Members with the Self-Reliance Plan\n\n\n\n\nAs assigned\n\n\n\n\nApprove Fast-Offering Assistance or Bishops\u2019 Orders\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\nCalling\n\n\n\n\nWard welfare and self-reliance specialists (if called)\n\n\n\n\nVisit and Assess Needs\n\n\n\n\nAs assigned\n\n\n\n\nTeach Principles of Self-Reliance\n\n\n\n\nAs assigned\n\n\n\n\nAssist Members with the Self-Reliance Plan\n\n\n\n\nAs assigned\n\n\n\n\nApprove Fast-Offering Assistance or Bishops\u2019 Orders\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.7\n\n\nRole of the Ward Council\n\n\n\n\nAn important role of the ward council is to plan how to care for those in need and to help them become self-reliant (see \n4.4\n). In discussing the needs of members, the council respects the desires of any who request confidentiality.\n\n\nAs ward councils consider how to care for those with temporal and emotional needs, they do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan ways to teach ward members how to apply principles of self-reliance (see \n22.1\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan ways to help those who have immediate needs, such as unemployment, and those who have longer-term needs, such as health problems or disabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify ward members whose skills might be helpful in responding to needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify possible work or service assignments for those who receive Church assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify members who could benefit from participating in a \nself-reliance group\n. These groups are generally organized by stake or ward councils.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify other government, community, or Church resources that can benefit members (see \n22.12\n and \n22.13\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan ways to give service in the community. Where \nJustServe.org\n is available, it may be used to identify such service opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWard councils also prepare a simple written plan for the ward to respond to emergencies. This plan should be coordinated with the stake\u2019s emergency plan (see \u201c\nStake and Ward Preparedness\n\u201d; see also \n22.9.1.3\n in this handbook).\n\n\nWard welfare and self-reliance specialists may be invited to ward council meetings as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.8\n\n\nRole of the Ward Youth Council\n\n\n\n\nOne purpose of the ward youth council is to help youth become consecrated followers of Jesus Christ (see \n29.2.6\n). Under the bishopric\u2019s guidance, the ward youth council plans ways to serve those in need in their ward and community.\n\n\nSpecific service activities can be planned during quorum and class presidency meetings. Where \nJustServe.org\n is available, it may be used to identify service opportunities in the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.9\n\n\nRoles of Stake Leaders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.9.1\n\n\nStake President and His Counselors\n\n\n\n\nThe stake president and his counselors lead the efforts of ministering to those with temporal and emotional needs and building self-reliance. The stake Relief Society presidency, high councilors, and other members of the stake council assist them.\n\n\nThe stake president and his counselors have the following responsibilities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeach the principles and blessings related to (1)\u00a0caring for those who have temporal and emotional needs and (2)\u00a0building self-reliance (see \n22.1\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeach the law of the fast and encourage members to give a generous fast offering (see \n22.2.2\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeach bishops how to properly provide Church assistance to those who have temporal needs (see \n22.9.1.1\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that elders quorum presidents and ward Relief Society presidents are taught about their roles in caring for those in need. High councilors and stake Relief Society presidencies help instruct these leaders (see \n22.9.2\n and \n22.9.3\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect the stake\u2019s efforts to prepare for and respond to emergencies (see \n22.9.1.3\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stake president also has the following responsibilities:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview fast-offering requests for medical expenses that exceed a bishop\u2019s approval limit. The stake president may approve requests up to his approval limit. He submits requests that exceed his approval limit to the Area Presidency for consideration (see \n22.5.2.1\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview any requests for Church assistance for bishops (see \n22.5.1.2\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServe as the agent stake president for welfare and self-reliance operations if assigned (see \n22.9.1.2\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stake presidency may assign one or more high councilors to help oversee the efforts of caring for those with temporal needs in the stake (see \n22.9.2\n). The stake presidency may also call stake welfare and self-reliance specialists to support these efforts (see \n22.9.4\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.9.1.1\n\n\nTeach Bishops the Principles of Providing Church Assistance\n\n\n\n\nThe stake president ensures that bishops are caring for those with temporal needs in their wards. He teaches bishops the principles and policies for providing Church assistance (see \n22.4\n and \n22.5\n).\n\n\nIn his interviews with bishops, the stake president reviews fast-offering payments from the ward\u2019s monthly financial statement. He also discusses with each bishop the principles he is using to help members. He counsels with the bishop about any payments or patterns in the statement that may show a misunderstanding of correct principles.\n\n\nPrinciples and practices for providing Church assistance are also discussed in the stake bishops\u2019 council (see \n22.11\n).\n\n\nThe stake president ensures that each bishop reviews the training in the video \u201c\nSacred Funds, Sacred Responsibilities\n\u201d at least once a year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.9.1.2\n\n\nServe as the Agent Stake President for Church Welfare and Self-Reliance Operations\n\n\n\n\nWhere applicable, the Area Presidency assigns an agent stake president to each welfare and self-reliance operation in their area. Examples of these operations include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBishops\u2019 storehouses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily Services offices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBYU\u2013Pathway Worldwide\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeseret Industries stores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe assigned stake president helps find volunteers to support the needs of the operation. The volunteers may come from the agent stake and from other stakes served by the operation.\n\n\n \n \n The agent stake president may organize an agent stake operating committee to oversee the operation. Committee members include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stake president or an assigned counselor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA high councilor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA member of the stake Relief Society presidency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe manager of the operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelfare and self-reliance specialists as needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.9.1.3\n\n\nRespond to Emergencies\n\n\n\n\nThe stake president oversees Church emergency response and communications within his stake. In disasters that cover more than one stake, the Area Presidency or an assigned Area Seventy may direct the response. Welfare and self-reliance managers support area and stake leaders in these efforts.\n\n\nStake presidents may call welfare and self-reliance specialists to oversee an emergency operations center, manage communications, or handle safety concerns. If needed, the Area Presidency or an Area Seventy may also appoint such specialists at the area level or coordinating council level.\n\n\nMinistering brothers and sisters report the conditions and needs of members to quorum and Relief Society leaders. These leaders report to the bishop, who reports to the stake presidency.\n\n\nThe stake presidency reports information to (1)\u00a0the Area Presidency or an assigned Area Seventy and (2)\u00a0the welfare and self-reliance manager. This report includes the status of members, missionaries, Church facilities, and the community. If Church members have been affected by a disaster, bishops may use fast offerings to help meet basic needs.\n\n\nThe stake president approves public information that is released locally by the Church. He coordinates this with the stake communication director if one is called (see \n6.2.1.7\n). He may serve as the Church spokesman to respond to questions from the media. He may also assign the stake communication director or another spokesperson to do this. In disasters that cover more than one stake, the Area Presidency or an assigned Area Seventy may manage public communications.\n\n\nChurch leaders may make the resources of the Church available to civil authorities during an emergency. With approval from the Area Presidency, Church buildings (except temples) may be used as shelters, first-aid stations, or feeding locations. Such use of a Church building should be coordinated with the assigned facilities manager. If another charitable or community organization is permitted to use the building, a usage agreement should be signed. See \u201c\nUse of Church Buildings in a Disaster\n\u201d for more information.\n\n\nMore information is available at \u201c\nEmergency Response Procedures\n.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.9.2\n\n\nHigh Councilors\n\n\n\n\nThe high councilor assigned to each elders quorum supports the quorum presidency in their responsibility to care for those in need and help them build self-reliance (see \n22.6.2\n).\n\n\nThe stake presidency may also assign one or more high councilors to do the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp teach stake and ward welfare and self-reliance specialists their roles, if specialists have been called (see \n22.9.4\n and \n22.6.4\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordinate volunteer efforts for welfare and self-reliance operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nServe on specialized working groups that coordinate resources related to self-reliance or community service (see \n22.10.2\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn stakes that support a welfare and self-reliance operation, a high councilor may be asked to serve on the agent stake operating committee (see \n22.9.1.2\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.9.3\n\n\nStake Relief Society Presidency\n\n\n\n\nThe stake Relief Society presidency supports ward Relief Society presidencies in their responsibility to care for those in need and help them build self-reliance (see \n22.6.2\n).\n\n\nMembers of the stake Relief Society presidency may be asked to serve on specialized working groups that coordinate resources related to self-reliance or community service (see \n22.10.2\n). \n \n \n In stakes that support a welfare and self-reliance operation, a presidency member may also be asked to serve on the agent stake operating committee (see \n22.9.1.2\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.9.4\n\n\nImage\nicon, optional resources\n Stake Welfare and Self-Reliance Specialists\n\n\n\n\nAs needed, the stake presidency may call individuals or couples as stake welfare and self-reliance specialists.\n\n\nSpecialists may be assigned to a specific area of focus.

They identify resources in the community and stake that can help ward leaders care for the temporal and emotional needs of their members (see \n22.12\n and \n22.13\n). They develop and maintain a simple written plan for the stake to respond to emergencies (see \u201c\nStake and Ward Preparedness\n\u201d).
